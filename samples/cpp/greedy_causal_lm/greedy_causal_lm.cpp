// Article: Tax adviser Duncan Hodgetts (pictured), from Birmingham, West Midlands, fell to his death from a Manhattan building . A British tax advisor has plunged more than 100ft to his death from an apartment window in a suspected suicide while on a business trip to New York. Duncan Hodgetts, 25, fell from the 14th floor window of the Executive Plaza building in midtown Manhattan at 8.30am yesterday morning. He was found on a third-floor balcony of the neighboring Michelangelo Hotel, near the Rockefeller Center, and was pronounced dead at the scene. It is understood the tax specialist for Ernst and Young, based in Birmingham, had been on a business trip when he fell from the balcony of one of the corporate apartments. An NYPD spokesman said  they were treating his death as suicide. He said: 'Officers were called at about 8.29am to the Michelangelo Hotel to reports a man had jumped to his death. 'His body was found on the third floor balcony of the hotel and he was pronounced deceased at the scene. 'Detectives from the mid-district precinct contacted his family and we are not treating the incident as suspicious. 'It is being treated as suicide and there are no further investigations into the matter at this stage.' A doorman at a nearby hotel confirmed to MailOnline that a body was removed from the apartment building at 11am on Monday. In a statement Ernst and Young said: 'We are very saddened to hear of the death of our colleague, Duncan Hodgetts. The 25-year-old reportedly fell from a 14th floor apartment window at the Executive Plaza building (pictured) at 8.30am on Monday . A spokesman for the New York Police Department said they were treating Mr Hodgetts' death as suicide . Tax adviser Duncan Hodgetts (pictured), from Birmingham, West Midlands, worked for accountancy firm Ernst and Young . 'The matter is being investigated by the New York Police Department and they can expect our full cooperation. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with Duncan's family, friends and colleagues.' The Michelangelo Hotel refused to comment on the death because Mr Hodgetts was not a guest of the hotel. Staff at Executive Plaza did not recognize Mr Hodgetts from photographs and referred questions to the building superintendent who was not immediately available for comment. The Executive Plaza at Rockefeller Center offer extended-stay, furnished apartments, from studios to two-bedrooms. A family member who answered the door at Mr Hodgett's £166,000 house that he shared with his parents Anthony, 65, and Sally, 62, in Shirley, West Midlands, said they were too upset to talk. 'It is all too raw at the moment,' he said. A neighbour, who did not wish to be named, added: 'He was such a lovely man and was driven by his work. 'You would see him come home at all hours but he always had a smile on his face and made time for you.' Mr Hodgetts was found on a third-floor balcony of the neighbouring Michelangelo Hotel on W 51stSt and was declared dead at the scene . It is understood the tax specialist for Ernst and Young (offices pictured) had been on a business trip when he fell from the balcony of the hotel . Mr Hodgetts shared this £166,000 home with his parents Anthony, 65, and Sally, 62, in Shirley, West Midlands . Mr Hodgetts' LinkedIn page says that he had worked for Ernst and Young since September 2011 . Another neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: 'I'm completely shocked. I have children the same age and my son grew up with him. 'I was just thinking the other day that I hadn't seen him in a while. 'He was such a lovely young man. Very quiet and very polite. I don't know if he had any children but as far as I know he wasn't married.' Mr Hodgetts' LinkedIn profile reveals that he had worked for Ernst and Young since September 2011. He also attended Durham University where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Physics. Before that he went to King Edward VI Camp Hill Grammar School for Boys in Kings Heath, Birmingham, between 2001 and 2008.

Article: While Google and Apple are developing self driving vehicles, Nasa has revealed its vision - and its a lot more fun. Called the Modular Robotic Vehicle, or MRV, it was developed at NASA's Johnson Space Center to show off the technologies that could let man move across other planets. On Earth, however, it also has some neat tricks - from the ability to park sideways to being able to spin on the spot, as well as being driven remotely at up to 70mph. Watch the buggy in action below . Unlike a normal car, the buggy has no mechanical linkages to the propulsion, steering, or brake actuators, the driver of an MRV relies completely on control inputs being converted to electrical signals and then transmitted by wires to the vehicle's motors. A turn of the steering wheel, for instance, is recorded by sensors and sent to computers at the rear of the vehicle. These computers interpret that signal and instruct motors at one or all four of the wheels to move at the appropriate rate, causing the vehicle to turn as commanded. Nasa says the vehicles was buit 'in order to advance technologies that have applications for future vehicles both in space and on Earth.' 'With seating for two people, MRV is a fully electric vehicle well-suited for busy urban environments, it says. MRV is driven by four independent wheel modules called e-corners. Each e-corner consists of a redundant steering actuator, a passive trailing arm suspension, an in-wheel propulsion motor, and a motor-driven friction braking system. Each e-corner can be controlled independently and rotated ±180 degrees about its axis. This allows for a suite of driving modes allowing MRV to maneuver unlike any traditional vehicle on the road. In addition to conventional front two wheel steering, the back wheels can also articulate allowing for turning radiuses as tight as zero. The driving mode can be switched so that all four wheels point and move in the same direction achieving an omni-directional, crab-like motion. This makes a maneuver such as parallel parking as easy as driving next to an available spot, stopping, and then operating sideways to slip directly in between two cars. 'This two-seater vehicle was designed to meet the growing challenges and demands of urban transportation,' said Mason Markee, also with Johnson. 'The MRV would be ideal for daily transportation in an urban environment with a designed top speed of 70 km/hr and range of 100 km of city driving on a single charge of the battery. 'The size and maneuverability of MRV gives it an advantage in navigating and parking in tight quarters.' With a designed top speed of around 70 km/hr, test driving proved to be a bit of fun. Justin Ridley told an Nasa magazine: 'It's like driving on ice but having complete control. 'It's a blast to ride in and even more fun to drive. We've talked about it being like an amusement park ride. 'The 'fun' of driving was not something we tried to design for, just something that came out of the design. 'Once we got it running many of us commented that we had no idea it was going to be able to do the things it does.' 'This work also allowed us to develop some technologies we felt were needed for our future rovers,' said Ridley. The driver controls MRV with a conventional looking steering wheel and accelerator/brake pedal assembly. The driving mode can be switched so that all four wheels point and move in the same direction - perfect for parallel parking. 'These include redundant by-wire systems, liquid cooling, motor technology, advanced vehicle control algorithms. 'We were able to learn a lot about these and other technologies by building this vehicle.' The buggy can also be controlled remotely, and in the future Nasa says this system can be expanded to allow for autonomous driving. The driver controls MRV with a conventional looking steering wheel and accelerator/brake pedal assembly. Both of these interfaces were specially designed to mimic the feel of the mechanical/hydraulic systems that people are used to feeling when driving their own cars. The buggy can also be controlled remotely, and in the future Nasa says this system can be expanded to allow for autonomous driving. 'While the vehicle as a whole is designed around operating in an urban environment, the core technologies are advancements used in many of our robotic systems and rovers,' said Mason. 'Actuators, motor controllers, sensors, batteries, BMS, component cooling, sealing, and software are all examples of technologies that are being devel oped and tested in MRV that will be used in next generation rover systems. 'The technologies developed in MRV have direct application in future manned vehicles undertaking missions on the surface of Earth's moon, on Mars, or even an asteroid. 'Additionally, MRV provides a platform to learn lessons that could drive the next generation of automobiles.

Article: David Cameron was ridiculed this morning after admitting he had suffered a 'brain fade' when appearing to forget which football team he supported. The Prime Minister, who insists he has been an Aston Villa fan 'all his life', was giving a campaign speech in south London when he joked that everyone should back his team – but then named West Ham instead of the West Midlands giants. Mr Cameron this morning claimed he became a Villa fan after watching the team beat Bayern Munich in the European Cup final as a child – but admitted he could not say what year the match took place or who scored the winner. The PM, who insists he has been an Aston Villa fan 'all his life', was giving a campaign speech in south London when he joked that everyone should back his team – but then named West Ham instead of the West Midlands giants . Mr Cameron, pictured making the gaffe in a speech in South London, said he had been 'overcome by something', adding: 'I don't know what happened to me, it was just one of those things' The Prime Minister said he had been 'overcome by something', adding: 'I don't know what happened to me, it was just one of those things.' He said he had gone 'off script' with the remark adding: 'I suppose it's just the campaign. By the time you have made as many speeches as I have on this campaign all sorts of funny things start popping out of your mouth.' Mr Cameron likened himself to the Green Party leader Natalie Bennett, who infamously blamed a 'brain fade' after a disastrous interview. He said: 'I had what Natalie would describe as a brain fade – I don't know what happened to me. I think I was overcome by something. But these things sometimes happen when you're on the stump.' Labour said the gaffe exposed the Prime Minister as a 'phoney'. Former Downing Street spin chief Alastair Campbell claimed it 'says a lot about his character', adding: 'Out of touch. Phoney. Believes nothing.' Shadow chancellor Ed Balls, a Norwich City fan, tweeted: 'Hey David Cameron... I'm off to see that football team I support this afternoon. Name escapes me... they play in yellow... Watford?' Mr Cameron has been pictured watching football with his son Elwyn - but admitted that he does not go to live games very often . Mr Cameron this morning claimed he became a Villa fan after watching the team beat Bayern Munich in the 1982 European Cup final - but admitted he could not remember the year of the triumph . Premier League footballers: Aston Villa's new midfield sensation Jack Grealish (left) and West Ham's young star Dan Potts (right) David Cameron's uncle Sir William Dugdale . David Cameron said he started supporting Aston Villa because his uncle was 'involved in the club'. In fact, the Prime Minister's late uncle Sir William Dugdale was Aston Villa's chairman from 1975 to 1982. In the final year of his chairmanship, Villa beat the odds to win the European Cup. Mr Cameron said he remembered the glory days back in the early 80s'. He said the star players Andy Gray and Brian Little 'got me going'. But Mr Cameron, interviewed by Sky News host Dermot Murnaghan, said: 'My uncle was involved in the club and back in the early 80s and all those successes - Andy Gray and Brian Little got me going. 'I don't go very often - in fact I haven't been for years and years - but I do try to keep up. We're going to escape the relegation zone, which we're out of now - and the cup final is very exciting.' Mr Cameron's late uncle Sir William Dugdale was Aston Villa's chairman from 1975 to 1982. Reminded of his comment in 2001 in the House of Commons that he wasn't actually a football fan, Mr Cameron said: 'I mean, I'm not a regular attender, I used to play football as a kid, my son plays football, and I try and sort of keep up with what's happening in the Premier League and see how Villa are doing. 'But when they get snug in the middle of the table I tend to sort of, I tend to back off a bit. When we get close to the bottom I get nervous, but I don't know what happened.' Mr Cameron was asked to show his support for Aston Villa by naming the year of the club's famous European Cup final victory in 1982. The PM said: 'It was early 80s, I'm not going to give you a date because I'll get it wrong.' He added: 'I'm not doing quiz time because I will get them all wrong.' Mr Cameron made the gaffe in a speech on multiculturalism in the UK – claiming it was possible to support a number of teams at the same time and still be British. He said: 'You can support Man United, the Windies and Team GB all at the same time.' But he then added: 'Of course I'd rather you supported West Ham.' Speaking on the Murnaghan programme broadcast this morning, Mr Cameron tried to explain away the gaffe. He said: 'I've been an Aston Villa fan all my life, I literally opened my mouth and I was going off-piste about the fact that in Britain you can be a supporter of the West Indies, a supporter of Manchester United, and a supporter of Team GB.'

Article: It has long been thought that Stone Age man abandoned their dead with little thought or respect. But the discovery of cremated bone, thought to be the earliest ever identified in Britain, could re-write the history of Mesolithic, or Middle Stone Age burial practices. The deposit containing the bone was discovered during excavations ahead of a new pipeline in Landford, Essex and is thought to date to 5,600 BC. The discovery of cremated bone (pictured), thought to be the earliest ever identified in Britain, could re-write the history of Mesolithic, or Middle Stone Age burial practices . The burnt material, which includes approximately just over four ounces (118g) of cremated bone, was uncovered by Oxford Archaeology. It was placed into a pit with a diameter of about three feet (one metre) and then backfilled with soil. Three radiocarbon dates, two from bone fragments and one from charcoal, have confirmed the remains are around 7,614 years old and fall within the the late Mesolithic, between 6,000 BC and 4,000 BC. Nick Gilmour, who lead the excavation, said ‘We were expecting this cremation to date to the Bronze Age - we were so surprised when the first radiocarbon date came back as Mesolithic that we did two more to double-check.’ The burnt material, which includes approximately just over four ounces (118g) of cremated bone, was uncovered by Oxford Archaeology. It was placed into a pit (pictured) with a diameter of about three feet (one metre) and then backfilled with soil . Little is known about Mesolithic man's beliefs, but the pit shows that ancient people understood how to create a pyre that was hot enough at over 600 °C to completely burn a corpse and appeared to respect the dead. This image is a still from a TV show called Meet the Ancestors showing what a Mesolithic hut may have looked like . The find is significant because it sheds light on early human society in Mesolithic Britain, when people were largely nomadic hunter gatherers before the arrival of farming. While little is known about their beliefs, the pit shows that ancient people understood how to create a pyre that was hot enough - at over 600 °C - to completely burn a corpse. It hints that people respected the dead enough to cremate them and not simply abandon them, as has been previously believed. Time and resources were invested in funerary practices despite a mobile hand-to-mouth existence, the experts explained. Dr Louise Loe, head of burials at Oxford Archaeology, analysed the bone to find that it represents the remains of at least one adult, despite the total weight being around seven per cent of what would be expected from a complete individual. Taken alongside evidence of a large amount of charcoal in the pit, it’s thought the material represents a deposit of some of the remains from a pyre, and not all of the cremated bone from it.

Before the discovery, just 20 examples of human bone dating from the British Mesolithic, which spans from 10,000 to 4,000BC, were found – and none of them had been cremated. But a group of three cremations from the period have been found in Ireland, so the ‘new’ site seems to fit into a wider European pattern of behaviour. Three Mesolithic flints were also discivered in the pit and while none are finished tools, they are sharp enough to have been used for cutting. More flints were found nearby, as well as a Bronze Age barrow, Early Roman site, Saxon settlement and a medieval building all where the Essex and Suffolk Water pipeline is planned. The find is significant because it sheds light on early human society in Mesolithic Britain, when people were largely nomadic hunter gatherers before the arrival of farming.

// Article: The former chairman of Bradford City was linked to eight other fires before the Valley Parade blaze that killed 56, a new book has claimed. Author Martin Fletcher claims the devastating fire was not an accident and has revealed a sequence of other blazes at businesses owned by or associated with Stafford Heginbotham, the club's chairman at the time. After an inquiry, high court judge Mr Justice Popplewell said the fire was not started deliberately and was caused by a discarded cigarette. West Yorkshire police today said in a statement that they would review any fresh evidence surrounding the tragedy. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: The fire at Bradford City's Valley Parade claimed 56 victims and injured 265 on May 11, 1985 . Then-Bradford chairman Heginbotham (left) was linked to eight other fires before the Valley Parade blaze, it has been claimed . Fletcher, a survivor of the blaze, spent 15 years researching the disaster in which his brother Andrew, 11, his father John, 34, his uncle Peter, 32, and his grandfather Eddie, 63, were all killed. He was 12 at the time and after painstaking investigation of public documents has published his findings in his book: 'Fifty-Six – The Story of the Bradford Fire', serialised in The Guardian. The fire broke out near half-time of Bradford's game against Lincoln on May 11, 1985, and was thought to have been started by a spark from a match or a cigarette dropped through a gap in the wooden frame of the main stand on to piles of rubbish which had been collecting for years. Within four minutes the stand was completely ablaze. The fire was thought to have been started by a spark from a match or a cigarette dropped through a gap in the wooden frame of the main stand .

Devastating: The deadly fire broke out near half-time during Bradford's game against Lincoln on May 11, 1985 . A police officer uses his helmet to shield the heat from his face as he runs in front of the burning stand . His research includes claims that Heginbotham, who died in 1995 at the age of 61, had been connected to other fires at business premises over a period of the previous 18 years, which resulted in large insurance claims. The book, published on Thursday, does not make any direct allegations but Mr Fletcher says Heginbotham's history with fires, which he claims resulted in payouts totalling around £27 million in today's terms, warranted further investigation. It was the worst stadium fire in the history of British football and prompted important safety changes in grounds across the land. The final of game of the season should have been a day of celebration for Bradford City. Before kick-off the team were presented with the trophy for winning the Third Division title as 11,076 fans watched on. But instead, May 11, 1985 ended in tragedy as flames engulfed the Main Stand at Valley Parade. The Valley Parade blaze is considered the worst stadium fire in the history of British football and prompted important safety changes in grounds across the land . The fire was noticed at 3.40pm towards the end of the first half and within minutes the stand packed with 4,000 spectators was fully ablaze. The disaster left 56 supporters dead and a further 265 injured. In the years that followed,  new legislation was introduced governing safety at the nation's sports grounds. The tragedy brought about an unprecedented  community spirit in the city, with, among many other initiatives, a fundraising drive for the Burns Unit at Bradford Royal Infirmary. In 2010, on the 25th anniversary, there were an estimated two thousand at the service in the city's Centenary Square but this year there has been such a surge of interest that the club considered moving it to Valley Parade. 'Could any man really be as unlucky as Heginbotham?' wrote Mr Fletcher. 'From standing around with a bunch of kids and onlookers on a Sunday afternoon in May 1967, as his former foam-cushion business went up in flames, to standing on the pitch at Valley Parade 18 years later, making noises about smoke bombs while 56 people perished behind him.'

The release of the book coincides with the 30th anniversary of the disaster, with English football set for a minute's silence ahead of all games on April 25, which will be Bradford's closest home fixture to the date and is bound to cause much consternation in the West Yorkshire city. 1: May 1967: fire in Stafford Heginbotham's factory at Cutler Heights Lane . 2: April 1968: fire at Genefoam Ltd, managing director is Heginbotham . 3: August 1970: store-room explosion at Matgoods, founded by Heginbotham . 4: Dec 1971: tenant fire at Castle Mills, Cleckheaton, owned by Heginbotham . 5: August 1977: fire at Yorkshire Knitting Mills, in Heginbotham-owned Douglas Mills building . 6: Dec 1977: fire at Coronet Marketing factory. Coronet a subsidiary of Tebro Toys, owned by Heginbotham . 7: Nov 1977: fire with toxic fumes at his Douglas Mills factory . 8: June 1981: fire in a plastics factory at Douglas Mills . No-one sought accountability for the fire once the official Popplewell Inquiry had recorded its findings following a series of hearings held less than a month after the blaze. But Mr Fletcher started to investigate nine years after the disaster, scouring back-copies of the local paper, The Telegraph and Argus for information. Sir Olive Popplewell told Sky News today that he was not aware of the previous links to fires in 1985. He said they were a 'remarkable coincidence' but that it did not alter his ruling that the tragedy was an 'accident exacerbated by negligence'. He added: 'If we had been aware of these fires at the time of course they would have demanded further investigation, but I am not sure what they would have revealed.' Former sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe said today that the new allegations do not justify a new inquiry in to the disaster. Mr Sutcliffe, MP for Bradford South and deputy leader of Bradford City council at the time of the tragedy, says he knew Heginbotham 'flew by the seat of his pants' in terms of the finances of the club but remains convinced by the conclusion of the inquiry by high court judge Mr Justice Popplewell that the fire was an accident.

The remains of the stand at Bradford's ground after the disaster on Saturday May 11, 1985 at Valley Parade . His many businesses included toy company Tebro Toys. He once described football as 'the opera of the people'. After an initial spell as Bradford chairman, he came back in 1983 when he and another local businessman, Jack Tordoff, saved Bradford from the receivers, buying the club for around £30,000 each. Heginbotham resigned as chairman in 1988 due to ill health. He died on April 21 1995 after a heart transplant. He was 61. Mr Sutcliffe told Press Association Sport: 'The inquiry by Mr Justice Popplewell concluded that it was caused by a discarded cigarette in what was an old wooden stand and I have not heard anything to convince me that that was not the case. 'Stafford Heginbotham was one of those football club chairmen of which there were many at the time who flew by the seat of his pants. I was deputy leader of the city council at the time and he did fly by the seat of his pants when it came to paying the bill for the police and so on. 'But I think the inquiry was very thorough at the time and I don't think there needs to be another because of this. I do not believe there was any sort of cover-up and in fact the inquiry led to a lot of recommendations on stadiums that together with the Taylor report came up with the right answers for football. Mr Fletcher started to investigate after a conversation with his mother nine years after the disaster, when she told him it had not been Heginbotham's first fire . The charred remains of a Bradford programme from the day of the fire in which 56 people were killed . 'There will always be speculation but I just think it was a tragedy that cost the lives of 56 people and injured many more, and has scarred the city for many years.' Author Martin Fletcher writes about his own experience at the Bradford Disaster, and asks why chairman Stafford Heginbotham was not investigated: . 'Why was it left to the 12-year-old who lost three generations and four members of his family, who was with over 40 people when they died within a 10-yard radius of him, who somehow got out of the stand, as the last person to get out, the only person to get out the front after being at the back, and the only person to survive the smoke?' Heginbotham's son, James, 47, told the Daily Mirror today: 'When you actually do your homework and see what he did for Bradford City Football Club it is a sickening accusation. It is just absolutely ridiculous. 'He never recovered from the fire. The stress of it is what killed him eventually. It was a shock hearing this today, it was such a long time ago. 'He's no longer here to defend himself. It's a real shame it has come to this. 'He devoted his entire life to that club. He saved the club on two separate occasions. 'I have never seen anybody more passionate about anything than he was about that club.' According to the Independent, it would be up to Home Secretary Theresa May to order a new inquiry but this would not be unlikely to happen before the election next month.

Mr Hichens, 28, will be working with one PC and two Police Community Service Officers in Hayle in Western Cornwall where the emergency services have been brought together under one roof. Jack of all trades: Andrew Hichens is trained to respond to crimes, fires and medical emergencies . New role: Father-of-two Mr Hichens has taken up his unique role in Hayle in Western Cornwall . As 'Tri-service Safety Officer', he does not have the power to make arrests and will mostly be patrolling his beat and spreading safety messages while on hand to respond to most 999 calls. Devon and Cornwall assistant chief constable Paul Netherton said there were plans to introduce the post to other areas. He said: 'The tri-service officer is a ground-breaking idea. It brings together the skills and training of the three emergency services into one individual.' Father of two Mr Hichens said: 'I want to become a familiar face in the community, someone the public are happy to see and who can respond to any incident or enquiry.' He applied for the role after eight years as a fireman, training as an emergency first responder, and completing a PCSO course. Badge of honour: He is called a 'tri-service safety officer' However, Devon and Cornwall Police Federation chairman Nigel Rabbitts said the new role would never be the same as having a fully-trained policeman, paramedic and fireman on call. He dismissed the new job as a 'publicity stunt' designed to reassure the public rather than provide any effective policing. He said: 'I don't see what there is to gain from it apart from some sort of public reassurance. Maybe the money should be better spent on full warranted police officers.' He also said he could not see it catching on, adding: 'To do all three would be impossible and you wouldn't be able to obtain your professional competencies.' Ready to go: Mr Hichens will mostly be patrolling his beat and spreading safety messages in his new role . Former Met officer Chris Hobbs said the job was unlikely to be represent the future of the emergency services as it would only really suit small, quiet, and rural beats. He said: 'If someone is able to accumulate all those numerous skills in becoming a jack or master of all trades that is fine. 'But realistically people join the police to be policemen, the fire service to be firefighters, and the ambulance service to be paramedics. 'Finding a good number of people that are able to qualify in all three is asking an awful lot. 'It is a great idea in a rural community but a bit of a non-starter in bigger towns and cities.'

Article: Sunday's trip to Loftus Road marks Chelsea’s 700th game under the ownership of Roman Abramovich, a period Jose Mourinho says has been positive not only for the club but for English football as a whole. Some would quibble with the second part of that statement, but Mourinho says that too will change. If the first 699 games under Russian rule has established Chelsea at the top of English and European football, Mourinho believes the next 700 will see them supply more players for the English national team as they implement Abramovich’s demand to follow Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules. Sunday's trip to Loftus Road marks Chelsea’s 700th game under the ownership of Roman Abramovich . Abramovich (right) celebrates with Frank Lampard (centre) and John Terry after Chelsea clinch their first Premier League title under his ownership in 2005 . The Russian finally got his hands on the Champions League trophy following Chelsea's success in 2012 . Mourinho also believes Chelsea’s adherence to FFP — ‘compared with other clubs and owners who didn’t want to play under the rules’, he pointed out in a thinly veiled dig at Manchester City — positions them as standard bearers for the English game. There can certainly be no doubt Chelsea are in a far stronger position than when Abramovich bought the club from Ken Bates for £140m on June 1, 2003. In the intervening 12 years he has spent in the region of £842.9m on transfer fees, winning three Premier Leagues, four FA Cups, three League Cups, one Europa League and one Champions League, but now, Mourinho says, Abramovich’s rule will benefit England as well as Chelsea. Jose Mourinho, seen here with Abramovich in 2004, has has been in charge of Chelsea for almost five of the Russian's 12 seasons at Stamford Bridge . The Blues have won three Premier Leagues, four FA Cups, three League Cups, one Europa League and one Champions League since 2004 . ‘He has been good for Chelsea, good for English football, good for European football,’ said Mourinho, who has been in charge for almost five of those 12 seasons. ‘Chelsea after him became strong, a top club in the country and a top club in Europe. I think that’s very, very good. I think it’s important and I think it’s also important the message Mr Abramovich and this club are passing now. ‘The decision to accept the [Financial Fair Play] rules and play under the rules I think is a big decision compared with other clubs and other owners that didn’t accept the rules and didn’t want to play under the rules. Chelsea are in a far stronger position than when Abramovich bought the club from Ken Bates in 2003 . ‘Will the next 700 games under him be good for the English national side? I believe so. In the first team, we had some important players in the national team. 'John Terry, Ashley Cole, Joe Cole, Frank Lampard, Wayne Bridge, Shaun Wright-Phillips. We had a nucleus of four, five players that were always in the national team. ‘Now we are going through a period where it’s just about Gary Cahill. But we have some young boys coming into the first-team. Ruben [Loftus-Cheek] is already here. Normally, in a few years they should be there [in the national side].’ Gary Cahill (above) is now Chelsea's only senior England international in the current first team squad . Mourinho believes the likes of Ruben Loftus-Cheek (left) and Dominic Solanke will represent Chelsea and England for years to come . Mourinho did not name them, but Dominic Solanke, Patrick Bamford, Lewis Baker and Isaiah Brown are thought to be highly-rated at Chelsea, who supply many of the players in England’s age-group teams. The question is whether their young English players will be given the chance in the first team at a club who can take a huge step towards the title by winning at QPR today. It is a game Chelsea go into mindful of decisive slips in last season’s title race but with the title firmly in their own hands now, Mourinho is confident no mistakes will be made. Chelsea are on the verge of a domestic double after picking up the Capital One Cup in March . Mourinho has won seven major trophies while in charge of the west London club . He added: ‘Don’t make me remember the game against Sunderland because that was the game which stopped us fighting for the title. I don’t want to speak again about that game. ‘Last season we were depending on others. We needed this team to lose a couple of points here, a couple of points there. This situation is different. ‘Now we are in a position where we can be isolated of everything. We don’t have to be watching Man City against Man United. We don’t have to be waiting for what they are going to do. It’s just us.’ Fabio Borini celebrates scoring the winning goal during Sunderland's 2-1 win against Chelsea last season . Mourinho believes last season's defeat against Sunderland 'stopped' Chelsea from fighting for the title .

Article: A woman on trial for murder admitted in a recorded interview with police that she had shot two men and fed their bodies to her pigs, the jury heard on Tuesday. Susan Monica, a 66-year-old pig farmer and welder from southern Oregon, went on trial on Tuesday in Medford. She has been charged with killing two handymen living on her 20-acre pig ranch in a small Jackson County community and dismembering the bodies. Accused serial killer Susan Monica interrupts court in Medford, Oregon on Tuesday on the opening day of her trial for allegedly murdering two men, dismembering their bodies and feeding them to her pigs . Susan Monica, pictured left in court in January 2014, and right in an undated mugshot, has been accused of killing Robert Haney and Stephen Delicino a year apart at her pig farm and dismembering their bodies . Both victims were shot in the head and dismembered in what prosecutors allege were separate murders committed more than a year apart. Monica appeared in court dressed in skirt, blouse and short wig. In opening statements, defense lawyer Garren Pedemonte said Monica shot the first victim in self-defense, and the second as a kind of mercy killing. Stephen Frank Delicino, 59, was shot by Monica in self-defense in summer 2012. The defendant has claimed that she shot the second man, 56-year-old Robert Harry Haney, to put him out of his misery because she found her pigs already feeding on him, The Mail Tribune reported. The second killing took place in September 2013. Police searched her pig ranch last year after Monica was discovered using a food stamps card belonging to Haney, and found remains of the two men. Remains of two handymen who had been living on Monica's 20-acre pig ranch (pictured) in Jackson County, Oregon were found in 2014 after she was caught using one victim's food stamps card .

Article: John Carver will turn to Siem de Jong in a bid to save Newcastle’s sorry season. The £6million summer signing suffered a collapsed lung in February and it was initially feared he would miss the remainder of the campaign, especially as it was the second time he had fallen victim to the problem. De Jong has started just one Premier League game since arriving from Ajax and he was only days away from a return to action following a five-month layoff with a torn thigh muscle when he was diagnosed with the collapsed lung. Newcastle attacking midfielder Siem de Jong could return to action before the end of the current campaign . De Jong, pictured in training on April 9 with his team-mates, will feature for Newcastle's reserve side . However, the 26-year-old returned to training earlier this month and will now feature for United’s reserves when they entertain Derby County at St James’ Park on Wednesday night, as will England Under 19 winger Rolando Aarons. Sunday’s visit of Spurs will probably come too soon for De Jong and hamstring absentee Aarons – who has not played since November - but Carver will be desperately hoping to have them available for the final five matches of a season which is in danger of ending on a sour note. Newcastle have lost five on the spin and their head coach has admitted that he does not know where the next point is coming from. They have scored just once in eight hours and would be fighting relegation had it not been for a five-match winning run under Alan Pardew last autumn. Supporters are organising a boycott ahead of the televised clash with Spurs, where thousands are expected to stay away in protest at Mike Ashley’s running of the club. Newcastle boss John Carver will be hoping his side will improve following the return of De Jong .
