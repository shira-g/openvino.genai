Article: David Cameron was ridiculed this morning after admitting he had suffered a 'brain fade' when appearing to forget which football team he supported. The Prime Minister, who insists he has been an Aston Villa fan 'all his life', was giving a campaign speech in south London when he joked that everyone should back his team – but then named West Ham instead of the West Midlands giants. Mr Cameron this morning claimed he became a Villa fan after watching the team beat Bayern Munich in the European Cup final as a child – but admitted he could not say what year the match took place or who scored the winner. The PM, who insists he has been an Aston Villa fan 'all his life', was giving a campaign speech in south London when he joked that everyone should back his team – but then named West Ham instead of the West Midlands giants . Mr Cameron, pictured making the gaffe in a speech in South London, said he had been 'overcome by something', adding: 'I don't know what happened to me, it was just one of those things' The Prime Minister said he had been 'overcome by something', adding: 'I don't know what happened to me, it was just one of those things.' He said he had gone 'off script' with the remark adding: 'I suppose it's just the campaign. By the time you have made as many speeches as I have on this campaign all sorts of funny things start popping out of your mouth.' Mr Cameron likened himself to the Green Party leader Natalie Bennett, who infamously blamed a 'brain fade' after a disastrous interview. He said: 'I had what Natalie would describe as a brain fade – I don't know what happened to me. I think I was overcome by something. But these things sometimes happen when you're on the stump.' Labour said the gaffe exposed the Prime Minister as a 'phoney'. Former Downing Street spin chief Alastair Campbell claimed it 'says a lot about his character', adding: 'Out of touch. Phoney. Believes nothing.' Shadow chancellor Ed Balls, a Norwich City fan, tweeted: 'Hey David Cameron... I'm off to see that football team I support this afternoon. Name escapes me... they play in yellow... Watford?' Mr Cameron has been pictured watching football with his son Elwyn - but admitted that he does not go to live games very often . Mr Cameron this morning claimed he became a Villa fan after watching the team beat Bayern Munich in the 1982 European Cup final - but admitted he could not remember the year of the triumph . Premier League footballers: Aston Villa's new midfield sensation Jack Grealish (left) and West Ham's young star Dan Potts (right) David Cameron's uncle Sir William Dugdale . David Cameron said he started supporting Aston Villa because his uncle was 'involved in the club'. In fact, the Prime Minister's late uncle Sir William Dugdale was Aston Villa's chairman from 1975 to 1982. In the final year of his chairmanship, Villa beat the odds to win the European Cup. Mr Cameron said he remembered the glory days back in the early 80s'. He said the star players Andy Gray and Brian Little 'got me going'. But Mr Cameron, interviewed by Sky News host Dermot Murnaghan, said: 'My uncle was involved in the club and back in the early 80s and all those successes - Andy Gray and Brian Little got me going. 'I don't go very often - in fact I haven't been for years and years - but I do try to keep up. We're going to escape the relegation zone, which we're out of now - and the cup final is very exciting.' Mr Cameron's late uncle Sir William Dugdale was Aston Villa's chairman from 1975 to 1982. Reminded of his comment in 2001 in the House of Commons that he wasn't actually a football fan, Mr Cameron said: 'I mean, I'm not a regular attender, I used to play football as a kid, my son plays football, and I try and sort of keep up with what's happening in the Premier League and see how Villa are doing. 'But when they get snug in the middle of the table I tend to sort of, I tend to back off a bit. When we get close to the bottom I get nervous, but I don't know what happened.' Mr Cameron was asked to show his support for Aston Villa by naming the year of the club's famous European Cup final victory in 1982. The PM said: 'It was early 80s, I'm not going to give you a date because I'll get it wrong.' He added: 'I'm not doing quiz time because I will get them all wrong.' Mr Cameron made the gaffe in a speech on multiculturalism in the UK – claiming it was possible to support a number of teams at the same time and still be British. He said: 'You can support Man United, the Windies and Team GB all at the same time.' But he then added: 'Of course I'd rather you supported West Ham.' Speaking on the Murnaghan programme broadcast this morning, Mr Cameron tried to explain away the gaffe. He said: 'I've been an Aston Villa fan all my life, I literally opened my mouth and I was going off-piste about the fact that in Britain you can be a supporter of the West Indies, a supporter of Manchester United, and a supporter of Team GB.'

Article: It has long been thought that Stone Age man abandoned their dead with little thought or respect. But the discovery of cremated bone, thought to be the earliest ever identified in Britain, could re-write the history of Mesolithic, or Middle Stone Age burial practices. The deposit containing the bone was discovered during excavations ahead of a new pipeline in Landford, Essex and is thought to date to 5,600 BC. The discovery of cremated bone (pictured), thought to be the earliest ever identified in Britain, could re-write the history of Mesolithic, or Middle Stone Age burial practices . The burnt material, which includes approximately just over four ounces (118g) of cremated bone, was uncovered by Oxford Archaeology. It was placed into a pit with a diameter of about three feet (one metre) and then backfilled with soil. Three radiocarbon dates, two from bone fragments and one from charcoal, have confirmed the remains are around 7,614 years old and fall within the the late Mesolithic, between 6,000 BC and 4,000 BC. Nick Gilmour, who lead the excavation, said ‘We were expecting this cremation to date to the Bronze Age - we were so surprised when the first radiocarbon date came back as Mesolithic that we did two more to double-check.’ The burnt material, which includes approximately just over four ounces (118g) of cremated bone, was uncovered by Oxford Archaeology. It was placed into a pit (pictured) with a diameter of about three feet (one metre) and then backfilled with soil . Little is known about Mesolithic man's beliefs, but the pit shows that ancient people understood how to create a pyre that was hot enough at over 600 °C to completely burn a corpse and appeared to respect the dead. This image is a still from a TV show called Meet the Ancestors showing what a Mesolithic hut may have looked like . The find is significant because it sheds light on early human society in Mesolithic Britain, when people were largely nomadic hunter gatherers before the arrival of farming. While little is known about their beliefs, the pit shows that ancient people understood how to create a pyre that was hot enough - at over 600 °C - to completely burn a corpse. It hints that people respected the dead enough to cremate them and not simply abandon them, as has been previously believed. Time and resources were invested in funerary practices despite a mobile hand-to-mouth existence, the experts explained. Dr Louise Loe, head of burials at Oxford Archaeology, analysed the bone to find that it represents the remains of at least one adult, despite the total weight being around seven per cent of what would be expected from a complete individual. Taken alongside evidence of a large amount of charcoal in the pit, it’s thought the material represents a deposit of some of the remains from a pyre, and not all of the cremated bone from it.

Before the discovery, just 20 examples of human bone dating from the British Mesolithic, which spans from 10,000 to 4,000BC, were found – and none of them had been cremated. But a group of three cremations from the period have been found in Ireland, so the ‘new’ site seems to fit into a wider European pattern of behaviour. Three Mesolithic flints were also discivered in the pit and while none are finished tools, they are sharp enough to have been used for cutting. More flints were found nearby, as well as a Bronze Age barrow, Early Roman site, Saxon settlement and a medieval building all where the Essex and Suffolk Water pipeline is planned. The find is significant because it sheds light on early human society in Mesolithic Britain, when people were largely nomadic hunter gatherers before the arrival of farming.

// Article: The former chairman of Bradford City was linked to eight other fires before the Valley Parade blaze that killed 56, a new book has claimed. Author Martin Fletcher claims the devastating fire was not an accident and has revealed a sequence of other blazes at businesses owned by or associated with Stafford Heginbotham, the club's chairman at the time. After an inquiry, high court judge Mr Justice Popplewell said the fire was not started deliberately and was caused by a discarded cigarette. West Yorkshire police today said in a statement that they would review any fresh evidence surrounding the tragedy. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: The fire at Bradford City's Valley Parade claimed 56 victims and injured 265 on May 11, 1985 . Then-Bradford chairman Heginbotham (left) was linked to eight other fires before the Valley Parade blaze, it has been claimed . Fletcher, a survivor of the blaze, spent 15 years researching the disaster in which his brother Andrew, 11, his father John, 34, his uncle Peter, 32, and his grandfather Eddie, 63, were all killed. He was 12 at the time and after painstaking investigation of public documents has published his findings in his book: 'Fifty-Six – The Story of the Bradford Fire', serialised in The Guardian. The fire broke out near half-time of Bradford's game against Lincoln on May 11, 1985, and was thought to have been started by a spark from a match or a cigarette dropped through a gap in the wooden frame of the main stand on to piles of rubbish which had been collecting for years. Within four minutes the stand was completely ablaze. The fire was thought to have been started by a spark from a match or a cigarette dropped through a gap in the wooden frame of the main stand .

Devastating: The deadly fire broke out near half-time during Bradford's game against Lincoln on May 11, 1985 . A police officer uses his helmet to shield the heat from his face as he runs in front of the burning stand . His research includes claims that Heginbotham, who died in 1995 at the age of 61, had been connected to other fires at business premises over a period of the previous 18 years, which resulted in large insurance claims. The book, published on Thursday, does not make any direct allegations but Mr Fletcher says Heginbotham's history with fires, which he claims resulted in payouts totalling around £27 million in today's terms, warranted further investigation. It was the worst stadium fire in the history of British football and prompted important safety changes in grounds across the land. The final of game of the season should have been a day of celebration for Bradford City. Before kick-off the team were presented with the trophy for winning the Third Division title as 11,076 fans watched on. But instead, May 11, 1985 ended in tragedy as flames engulfed the Main Stand at Valley Parade. The Valley Parade blaze is considered the worst stadium fire in the history of British football and prompted important safety changes in grounds across the land . The fire was noticed at 3.40pm towards the end of the first half and within minutes the stand packed with 4,000 spectators was fully ablaze. The disaster left 56 supporters dead and a further 265 injured. In the years that followed,  new legislation was introduced governing safety at the nation's sports grounds. The tragedy brought about an unprecedented  community spirit in the city, with, among many other initiatives, a fundraising drive for the Burns Unit at Bradford Royal Infirmary. In 2010, on the 25th anniversary, there were an estimated two thousand at the service in the city's Centenary Square but this year there has been such a surge of interest that the club considered moving it to Valley Parade. 'Could any man really be as unlucky as Heginbotham?' wrote Mr Fletcher. 'From standing around with a bunch of kids and onlookers on a Sunday afternoon in May 1967, as his former foam-cushion business went up in flames, to standing on the pitch at Valley Parade 18 years later, making noises about smoke bombs while 56 people perished behind him.'

The release of the book coincides with the 30th anniversary of the disaster, with English football set for a minute's silence ahead of all games on April 25, which will be Bradford's closest home fixture to the date and is bound to cause much consternation in the West Yorkshire city. 1: May 1967: fire in Stafford Heginbotham's factory at Cutler Heights Lane . 2: April 1968: fire at Genefoam Ltd, managing director is Heginbotham . 3: August 1970: store-room explosion at Matgoods, founded by Heginbotham . 4: Dec 1971: tenant fire at Castle Mills, Cleckheaton, owned by Heginbotham . 5: August 1977: fire at Yorkshire Knitting Mills, in Heginbotham-owned Douglas Mills building . 6: Dec 1977: fire at Coronet Marketing factory. Coronet a subsidiary of Tebro Toys, owned by Heginbotham . 7: Nov 1977: fire with toxic fumes at his Douglas Mills factory . 8: June 1981: fire in a plastics factory at Douglas Mills . No-one sought accountability for the fire once the official Popplewell Inquiry had recorded its findings following a series of hearings held less than a month after the blaze. But Mr Fletcher started to investigate nine years after the disaster, scouring back-copies of the local paper, The Telegraph and Argus for information. Sir Olive Popplewell told Sky News today that he was not aware of the previous links to fires in 1985. He said they were a 'remarkable coincidence' but that it did not alter his ruling that the tragedy was an 'accident exacerbated by negligence'. He added: 'If we had been aware of these fires at the time of course they would have demanded further investigation, but I am not sure what they would have revealed.' Former sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe said today that the new allegations do not justify a new inquiry in to the disaster. Mr Sutcliffe, MP for Bradford South and deputy leader of Bradford City council at the time of the tragedy, says he knew Heginbotham 'flew by the seat of his pants' in terms of the finances of the club but remains convinced by the conclusion of the inquiry by high court judge Mr Justice Popplewell that the fire was an accident.

Tributes were paid to the 56 who were killed by the fire on the same day Bradford should have been celebrating . The remains of the stand at Bradford's ground after the disaster on Saturday May 11, 1985 at Valley Parade . His many businesses included toy company Tebro Toys. He once described football as 'the opera of the people'. After an initial spell as Bradford chairman, he came back in 1983 when he and another local businessman, Jack Tordoff, saved Bradford from the receivers, buying the club for around £30,000 each. Heginbotham resigned as chairman in 1988 due to ill health. He died on April 21 1995 after a heart transplant. He was 61. Mr Sutcliffe told Press Association Sport: 'The inquiry by Mr Justice Popplewell concluded that it was caused by a discarded cigarette in what was an old wooden stand and I have not heard anything to convince me that that was not the case. 'Stafford Heginbotham was one of those football club chairmen of which there were many at the time who flew by the seat of his pants. I was deputy leader of the city council at the time and he did fly by the seat of his pants when it came to paying the bill for the police and so on. 'But I think the inquiry was very thorough at the time and I don't think there needs to be another because of this. I do not believe there was any sort of cover-up and in fact the inquiry led to a lot of recommendations on stadiums that together with the Taylor report came up with the right answers for football. Mr Fletcher started to investigate after a conversation with his mother nine years after the disaster, when she told him it had not been Heginbotham's first fire . The charred remains of a Bradford programme from the day of the fire in which 56 people were killed . 'There will always be speculation but I just think it was a tragedy that cost the lives of 56 people and injured many more, and has scarred the city for many years.' Author Martin Fletcher writes about his own experience at the Bradford Disaster, and asks why chairman Stafford Heginbotham was not investigated: . 'Why was it left to the 12-year-old who lost three generations and four members of his family, who was with over 40 people when they died within a 10-yard radius of him, who somehow got out of the stand, as the last person to get out, the only person to get out the front after being at the back, and the only person to survive the smoke?' Heginbotham's son, James, 47, told the Daily Mirror today: 'When you actually do your homework and see what he did for Bradford City Football Club it is a sickening accusation. It is just absolutely ridiculous. 'He never recovered from the fire. The stress of it is what killed him eventually. It was a shock hearing this today, it was such a long time ago. 'He's no longer here to defend himself. It's a real shame it has come to this. 'He devoted his entire life to that club. He saved the club on two separate occasions. 'I have never seen anybody more passionate about anything than he was about that club.' According to the Independent, it would be up to Home Secretary Theresa May to order a new inquiry but this would not be unlikely to happen before the election next month.

Article: He's all three emergency services rolled into one. Andrew Hichens has become the first person to be trained and equipped as a so-called first responder to all types of 999 call. Mr Hichens, 28, will be working with one PC and two Police Community Service Officers in Hayle in Western Cornwall where the emergency services have been brought together under one roof. Jack of all trades: Andrew Hichens is trained to respond to crimes, fires and medical emergencies . New role: Father-of-two Mr Hichens has taken up his unique role in Hayle in Western Cornwall . As 'Tri-service Safety Officer', he does not have the power to make arrests and will mostly be patrolling his beat and spreading safety messages while on hand to respond to most 999 calls. Devon and Cornwall assistant chief constable Paul Netherton said there were plans to introduce the post to other areas. He said: 'The tri-service officer is a ground-breaking idea. It brings together the skills and training of the three emergency services into one individual.' Father of two Mr Hichens said: 'I want to become a familiar face in the community, someone the public are happy to see and who can respond to any incident or enquiry.' He applied for the role after eight years as a fireman, training as an emergency first responder, and completing a PCSO course. Badge of honour: He is called a 'tri-service safety officer' However, Devon and Cornwall Police Federation chairman Nigel Rabbitts said the new role would never be the same as having a fully-trained policeman, paramedic and fireman on call. He dismissed the new job as a 'publicity stunt' designed to reassure the public rather than provide any effective policing. He said: 'I don't see what there is to gain from it apart from some sort of public reassurance. Maybe the money should be better spent on full warranted police officers.' He also said he could not see it catching on, adding: 'To do all three would be impossible and you wouldn't be able to obtain your professional competencies.' Ready to go: Mr Hichens will mostly be patrolling his beat and spreading safety messages in his new role . Former Met officer Chris Hobbs said the job was unlikely to be represent the future of the emergency services as it would only really suit small, quiet, and rural beats. He said: 'If someone is able to accumulate all those numerous skills in becoming a jack or master of all trades that is fine. 'But realistically people join the police to be policemen, the fire service to be firefighters, and the ambulance service to be paramedics. 'Finding a good number of people that are able to qualify in all three is asking an awful lot. 'It is a great idea in a rural community but a bit of a non-starter in bigger towns and cities.'

Article: Sunday's trip to Loftus Road marks Chelsea’s 700th game under the ownership of Roman Abramovich, a period Jose Mourinho says has been positive not only for the club but for English football as a whole. Some would quibble with the second part of that statement, but Mourinho says that too will change. If the first 699 games under Russian rule has established Chelsea at the top of English and European football, Mourinho believes the next 700 will see them supply more players for the English national team as they implement Abramovich’s demand to follow Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules. Sunday's trip to Loftus Road marks Chelsea’s 700th game under the ownership of Roman Abramovich . Abramovich (right) celebrates with Frank Lampard (centre) and John Terry after Chelsea clinch their first Premier League title under his ownership in 2005 . The Russian finally got his hands on the Champions League trophy following Chelsea's success in 2012 . Mourinho also believes Chelsea’s adherence to FFP — ‘compared with other clubs and owners who didn’t want to play under the rules’, he pointed out in a thinly veiled dig at Manchester City — positions them as standard bearers for the English game. There can certainly be no doubt Chelsea are in a far stronger position than when Abramovich bought the club from Ken Bates for £140m on June 1, 2003. In the intervening 12 years he has spent in the region of £842.9m on transfer fees, winning three Premier Leagues, four FA Cups, three League Cups, one Europa League and one Champions League, but now, Mourinho says, Abramovich’s rule will benefit England as well as Chelsea. Jose Mourinho, seen here with Abramovich in 2004, has has been in charge of Chelsea for almost five of the Russian's 12 seasons at Stamford Bridge . The Blues have won three Premier Leagues, four FA Cups, three League Cups, one Europa League and one Champions League since 2004 . ‘He has been good for Chelsea, good for English football, good for European football,’ said Mourinho, who has been in charge for almost five of those 12 seasons. ‘Chelsea after him became strong, a top club in the country and a top club in Europe. I think that’s very, very good. I think it’s important and I think it’s also important the message Mr Abramovich and this club are passing now. ‘The decision to accept the [Financial Fair Play] rules and play under the rules I think is a big decision compared with other clubs and other owners that didn’t accept the rules and didn’t want to play under the rules. Chelsea are in a far stronger position than when Abramovich bought the club from Ken Bates in 2003 . ‘Will the next 700 games under him be good for the English national side? I believe so. In the first team, we had some important players in the national team. 'John Terry, Ashley Cole, Joe Cole, Frank Lampard, Wayne Bridge, Shaun Wright-Phillips. We had a nucleus of four, five players that were always in the national team. ‘Now we are going through a period where it’s just about Gary Cahill. But we have some young boys coming into the first-team. Ruben [Loftus-Cheek] is already here. Normally, in a few years they should be there [in the national side].’ Gary Cahill (above) is now Chelsea's only senior England international in the current first team squad . Mourinho believes the likes of Ruben Loftus-Cheek (left) and Dominic Solanke will represent Chelsea and England for years to come . Mourinho did not name them, but Dominic Solanke, Patrick Bamford, Lewis Baker and Isaiah Brown are thought to be highly-rated at Chelsea, who supply many of the players in England’s age-group teams. The question is whether their young English players will be given the chance in the first team at a club who can take a huge step towards the title by winning at QPR today. It is a game Chelsea go into mindful of decisive slips in last season’s title race but with the title firmly in their own hands now, Mourinho is confident no mistakes will be made. Chelsea are on the verge of a domestic double after picking up the Capital One Cup in March . Mourinho has won seven major trophies while in charge of the west London club . He added: ‘Don’t make me remember the game against Sunderland because that was the game which stopped us fighting for the title. I don’t want to speak again about that game. ‘Last season we were depending on others. We needed this team to lose a couple of points here, a couple of points there. This situation is different. ‘Now we are in a position where we can be isolated of everything. We don’t have to be watching Man City against Man United. We don’t have to be waiting for what they are going to do. It’s just us.’ Fabio Borini celebrates scoring the winning goal during Sunderland's 2-1 win against Chelsea last season . Mourinho believes last season's defeat against Sunderland 'stopped' Chelsea from fighting for the title .

Article: A woman on trial for murder admitted in a recorded interview with police that she had shot two men and fed their bodies to her pigs, the jury heard on Tuesday. Susan Monica, a 66-year-old pig farmer and welder from southern Oregon, went on trial on Tuesday in Medford. She has been charged with killing two handymen living on her 20-acre pig ranch in a small Jackson County community and dismembering the bodies. Accused serial killer Susan Monica interrupts court in Medford, Oregon on Tuesday on the opening day of her trial for allegedly murdering two men, dismembering their bodies and feeding them to her pigs . Susan Monica, pictured left in court in January 2014, and right in an undated mugshot, has been accused of killing Robert Haney and Stephen Delicino a year apart at her pig farm and dismembering their bodies . Both victims were shot in the head and dismembered in what prosecutors allege were separate murders committed more than a year apart. Monica appeared in court dressed in skirt, blouse and short wig. In opening statements, defense lawyer Garren Pedemonte said Monica shot the first victim in self-defense, and the second as a kind of mercy killing. Stephen Frank Delicino, 59, was shot by Monica in self-defense in summer 2012. The defendant has claimed that she shot the second man, 56-year-old Robert Harry Haney, to put him out of his misery because she found her pigs already feeding on him, The Mail Tribune reported. The second killing took place in September 2013. Police searched her pig ranch last year after Monica was discovered using a food stamps card belonging to Haney, and found remains of the two men. Remains of two handymen who had been living on Monica's 20-acre pig ranch (pictured) in Jackson County, Oregon were found in 2014 after she was caught using one victim's food stamps card .

Article: John Carver will turn to Siem de Jong in a bid to save Newcastle’s sorry season. The £6million summer signing suffered a collapsed lung in February and it was initially feared he would miss the remainder of the campaign, especially as it was the second time he had fallen victim to the problem. De Jong has started just one Premier League game since arriving from Ajax and he was only days away from a return to action following a five-month layoff with a torn thigh muscle when he was diagnosed with the collapsed lung. Newcastle attacking midfielder Siem de Jong could return to action before the end of the current campaign . De Jong, pictured in training on April 9 with his team-mates, will feature for Newcastle's reserve side . However, the 26-year-old returned to training earlier this month and will now feature for United’s reserves when they entertain Derby County at St James’ Park on Wednesday night, as will England Under 19 winger Rolando Aarons. Sunday’s visit of Spurs will probably come too soon for De Jong and hamstring absentee Aarons – who has not played since November - but Carver will be desperately hoping to have them available for the final five matches of a season which is in danger of ending on a sour note. Newcastle have lost five on the spin and their head coach has admitted that he does not know where the next point is coming from. They have scored just once in eight hours and would be fighting relegation had it not been for a five-match winning run under Alan Pardew last autumn. Supporters are organising a boycott ahead of the televised clash with Spurs, where thousands are expected to stay away in protest at Mike Ashley’s running of the club. Newcastle boss John Carver will be hoping his side will improve following the return of De Jong .

Article: (CNN)What would you do if a complete stranger asked you for $100, or offered you an apple in a parking lot without explanation? These are only two of the 100 challenges Chinese-born, American-based Jia Jiang put himself up to when he decided to blog about "100 Days of Rejection", a project he launched after he quit his comfortable six-figure job to follow his dreams of being an entrepreneur at the age of 30, just weeks before his first child was born. After his tech start-up was declined investment, Jiang decided to confront his fear of rejection head-on. This led to his writing his book called Rejection Proof, part self-help and part motivational/autobiography, which is being released this week. Famously, in 2012 on his third day of the project, Jiang asked Austin, Texas, Krispy Kreme manager (Jackie Braun) to make him five interlinked donuts to mimic the Olympic symbol. To his surprise, she rose to the challenge and his rejection request faltered. He shared his video and it went viral on Reddit. Before long, Jiang (and Braun) were invited on talk shows and Jiang was being asked to speak at events across the US. Jiang was even offered jobs as his project continued and his fame grew. That wasn't the goal of the project though. "I'm really just a person trying to overcome my own fears," explained Jiang. The project started out to help "fix my own problems, and now I'm helping others fix theirs," he said. "The fear of rejection really holds people back. I'm trying to demystify the idea of rejection." Jiang, who as a child dreamed of being Bill Gates and has been viewed 7 million times on YouTube, has found his entrepreneurial dream in a different role for the moment. "My goal is to turn rejection into opportunity. I always thought it was something to run away from, but if we can embrace it, we can turn it into a lot more than an obstacle." 8 top tips in making rejection work for you: . 1 - The fear of rejection holds us back a lot more than actual rejection. By putting ourselves out there, the world will usually open itself up to you. Though the world can seem cruel and cold, actually humans have a hard time saying no. So open yourself up, don't be afraid to ask for something. If you fail, remember it's not about you. 2 -  Rejection is more or less a numbers game. Sometimes the most far-fetched idea gets a yes. If you talk to enough people, somebody will say yes to you. J.K. Rowling went through 12 rejections to get her yes for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. 3 - You cannot use rejection to measure the merit of an idea. Sometimes if you really want to change the world, getting rejection is a must. Rejection is a human interaction with two sides. It often says more about the rejector than the rejectee, and should never be used as the universal truth and sole judgment of merit. 4 - Don't run away after a no. The most common thing we do when we're rejected is we want to run because rejection is painful - you're hurt, angry and you lose confidence. But actually if we know how to handle it, we can often minimize the chance of rejection. Be confident, engaging, collaborate. I used all of these traits to maximise getting a yes. 5 - Ask why? When you get rejected you have to find out why. Then spend time to find solutions to solve that why. Sometimes through this process you learn there is something else you can ask for. Ask for an intermediate position rather than the top position. 6 - Set a number of how many no's you can take. In his book, Jiang helps his wife set out to get her dream job at Google. He tells her that instead of thinking about getting a job, she needs to prepare herself for how many no's she can take.  In the end, she was offered a job at Google. 7 - Be invincible. By the end of his project, Jiang said he felt he could ask anything from anyone and not have the pain of rejection. It was a gradual process - gradually my comfort zone expanded. It's like a muscle, I could become stronger and stronger. 8 - Stand tall and remember rejection is an opinion. People are who they are. A lot of people will reject you because of their mood, their education, their upbringing, and you can't change who they are. But you can stand confidently. Innate confidence comes across.

Article: A German language teacher has been suspended in France after suggesting that panzers should invade the country again so as 'subdue unruly pupils'. The Frenchwoman also used her classes to defend Adolf Hitler's domestic record, and his plans for overseas expansion. 'He was a good man who built motorways and liked music,' she is alleged to have said, before being suspended from the Auguste Remoir college in Limoges, west-central France. The German language teacher suggested that tanks (pictured is a panzer during the Second World War) should be used to invade France again to subdue unruly pupils . Hundreds of German tanks rolled into the country in May 1940 as their Blitzkrieg led to France becoming part of the Third Reich. Yet, according to complaining parents who passed on the comment to other teachers, the woman said she hoped 'German tanks come to Renoir to subdue unruly pupils'. Seventeen of the 20 pupils in her class signed a petition against the teacher, and it was quickly acted on by the authorities. Parent teacher association president, Maurice Sourdioux, said: 'In my experience, this kind of procedure is extremely rare in national education. I have never seen it anywhere else.' She has since been suspended from the Auguste Remoir college in Limoges, west-central France (pictured) The teacher, who has been at the school since September, has denied any wrong doing, saying she was 'very shocked by the extent of the case'. References to the Second World War are particularly sensitive in France, where a collaborationist government worked with the Nazis. State institutions including the SNCF railway company and police in major cities such as Paris assisted in the Holocaust too. Despite this, there are regular cases of far right sympathisers expressing support for the kind of racism and anti-Semitism championed by the Nazis. Last month, a music teacher in Berlin was questioned by police after forcing pupils to march up and down singing a Nazi song. Germany had been forbidden from producing and using tanks because of the Treaty of Versailles. But under a secret program  code named the 'Traktor', they began developing armored military vehicles and artillery. The early tanks which were mostly used for training were then tested in the Soviet Union. The early German panzer force's success was mainly down to tactical innovation rather than the quality of the vehicles. But many of their later tanks outclassed Allied armor, delivering more casualties than they took in most engagements during the Second World War. A parade of German tanks crossed the desert plans of Libya in the Second World War in May 1941 . Production of the first tank, the Panzer I, began in 1932 and mass production began in 1934. It had been intended only as a training tank to introduce the army to armored warfare but the Panzer I  saw combat in Poland, France, the Soviet Union and North Africa during the Second World War. The army went onto to produce the Panzer II to fill the gap after the construction of medium tanks,  Panzer III and IV, fell behind schedule. Along with the Panzer I, the II made up the bulk of German tank forces during the invasion of Poland and France. The final Panzer, IV, was the workhorse force during the war making up half of all German tanks. It was also the only German tank to remain in production for the entire war- with a total of 8,800 produced.

Article: (CNN)The United Nations is appealing for $174 million to help Nigerian refugees who've fled to neighboring nations following militant attacks. Boko Haram has killed thousands in the nation's northeast by attacking villages, schools, churches and mosques. It has also kidnapped students, including more than 200 schoolgirls abducted in April last year. A majority of them remain missing. The militants have attacked relentlessly for six years, sending 192,000 people seeking shelter in Cameroon, Niger and Chad. "Displaced people in northeastern Nigeria and across borders are in a very dramatic situation, they fear for their lives and are at this point unable to return to their homes," said Liz Ahua, who's coordinating Nigerian refugee efforts for the U.N. Aid agencies are scrambling to provide the refugees with clean water, shelter, food and access to education. "In the refugee camps, thousands of school-age refugee children cannot attend school because of lack of classrooms and teachers," Ahua said. Mental health needs are crucial to help the survivors of physical attacks and those who've witnessed violence, according to the U.N.  Some children are separated from their parents amid the trauma. "The conflict has had a devastating impact on children, including many who were forcibly recruited by the insurgents in Nigeria," Ahua said. The appeal encompasses the needs of 23 agencies and nongovernmental organizations helping the refugees. "Adequate funding is crucial to make sure aid agencies can improve the living conditions for refugees in asylum countries and respond to their protection needs," Ahua said. "We relocate refugees away from the conflict border areas, and establish additional refugee camps where needed." The Islamist group has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. An additional 1.2 million people are displaced within Nigeria as a result of the insurgency. CNN's Pierre Meilhan contributed to this report .

Article: You’ve found the house of your dreams – but you want to make sure the costly nightmare of dry rot isn’t lurking under the carpets and skirting boards. The solution? Call in the dogs! The appropriately named Mark Doggett has trained his two animals to sniff out the destructive fungus in old houses where it can hide in places a person would miss. Mr Doggett gave up a ten-year career in construction after hitting on the idea to set up a business using the animals’ sense of smell, which is said to be up to a million times better than that of humans. Skilled: Meg and Jess, pictured with Mark Doggett, were trained for six months to sniff out dry rot . On the case: Four-year-old Border collie Meg gets down to work sniffing out the destructive fungus . When they find dry rot they stop, stare at it and point with their nose, only moving from the affected area when Mr Doggett gives them a special signal . After six months of training, four-year-old border collie Meg and 22-month-old English springer spaniel Jess went to work. When they find dry rot they stop, stare at it and point with their nose, only moving from the affected area when Mr Doggett gives them a special signal. The businessman, 30, from Wolverhampton, whose company is called Enviro-Dogs, said: ‘We’re unique in offering a dry rot detection service using dogs to the public. The dogs can go out to domestic properties or surveyors can hire us as part of their report. Dry rot is wood decay caused by the fungus Serpula lacrymans that digests the parts of the wood which give it strength. By the time there are visible signs, serious damage will have been done. It begins as a microscopic spore but the final stage is a fruiting body which pumps out new spores. Once airborne they can damage all parts of a property, penetrating brickwork and concrete floors seeking a wood source. If not treated, it can destroy a building. “It’s not really work for the dogs – they see it as the best game in the world and they enjoy it because it’s working on their natural instincts. The dogs are so effective because they can detect dry rot at much earlier stages. ‘In hidden places dry rot can grow for years without anyone noticing it. It can be hard to find but the dogs can detect it through carpet and wall panelling. ‘It takes a couple of minutes for the dog to search a room. People are slightly dubious when they first hear about us but after seeing what we can do they’re amazed.’ Prices start at £200 for a call-out and the business has been so successful Mr Doggett plans to expand it by training the dogs to hunt out bed bugs for hotels and hospitals.

Article: Police in Argentina are hunting a family-of-six who crammed onto one motorbike before riding through the streets without helmets. They were spotted driving through the city of San Miguel de Tucuman in Argentina's north-western province of Tucuman. A man was pictured holding the handlebars of the bike while three young children straddled the petrol tank in front of him and a girl and a woman sat on the seat behind him. People carrier: Two adults and four children were pictured riding on the same motorbike in San Miguel de Tucuman, Argentina . It comes just weeks after a similar  pictured emerged of a family of seven riding on the same motorbike though the city of Junin in Argentina's eastern province of Buenos Aires. Describing the most recent case, passer-by Etel Ramirez Nazario, 46, said: 'It was shocking to see. 'Three little children who couldn't be more than three or four were all at the front, the dad was behind them. 'Behind him was another child who I'd say was about seven or eight and then the mum on the back. 'They were going pretty fast and none of them had helmets. I dread to think what would have happened if they had hit another car or fallen off.' Police are also hunting a family of seven seen riding on the same motorbike through the city of Junin just weeks ago . The family's actions were condemned on social media sites after pictures of the incident appeared online in Argentina. One user, Amatista Avalos Muro, wrote: 'This is absolutely unbelievable. These parents are setting their kids up for death.' Another, Ramses Crespo Cruz, posted: 'So sad that some parents are so irresponsible. Those poor children.' Police say they are looking for the parents. A spokesman said: 'We have seen the picture and strongly condemn this utterly irresponsible and dangerous behaviour. 'We have appealed for anyone who recognises the family to come forward.'

Article: Abraham Lincoln and George Washington were gay, says a new book by a gay activist and award winning writer. Larry Kramer, 79, says he believes what's written in his history book is true though he is selling it as fiction to avoid legal troubles. In Volume One of his two part book 'The American People,' Kramer says that Abraham Lincoln was gay and his killer John Wilkes Booth was actually Lincoln's spurned gay lover. 'We know that Abraham Lincoln was gay,' Kramer told CBS in an interview about the book which came out this month. Were they gay?: Writer and gay activist Larry Kramer claims that Abraham Lincoln (left) and George Washington (right) were gay . The American People: Volume one of the two part book by Larry Kramer explores prehistoric America's unwritten gay history up to the present day . Abraham Lincoln . According to Larry Kramer, Abraham Lincoln slept with several men including actor John Wilkes Booth who later fatally shot him in a theater on April 14, 1965. Kramer claims that the motive for murder was not Booth's anger over the Civil War but was his unrequited love for the former president. Another indicator that Lincoln was gay is that he would share beds with other men, especially when his wife Mary left town. One such man was Captain David Derickson who would visit Lincoln at a retreat from the White House called the Soldier's Home. Lincoln has been quoted as saying of Derickson, 'The captain and I are getting quite thick.' George Washington . Larry Kramer says that historians just don't have 'gaydar' when it comes to studying historic figures and that George was was 'basically a big queen.' Larry Kramer said in an interview with Sirius that George Washington loved decorating battle gear and that he was a bit of a dandy in his love of showmanship. 'In the case of Washington, he was a big queen, basically,' Kramer said. 'He decorated everything. He designed all the uniforms, the buttons. The correspondence exists with all the dealers he dealt with in England to make everything. And then there was a man called Baron Von Steuben, who was German, who designed all the maneuvers for all the troops of all the great armies in Europe. And he kept getting thrown out after he made the armies real – like Rockettes . He got kicked out and he came to George. And he and George hit it off like nobody’s business.' Alexander Hamilton . According to Kramer, Alexander Hamilton was in love with George Washington claims the pair had an erotic father and son attraction. Alexander Hamilton was also supposedly involved with a young officer named John Laurens to whom he wrote 'love letters. ' 'You should not have taken advantage of my sensibility to steal into my affections without my consent. But as you have done it, and as we are generally indulgent to those we love, I shall not scruple to pardon the fraud you have committed, on condition that for my sake, if not for your own, you will always continue to merit the partiality, which you have artfully instilled into me,' said one of those letters to Laurens. In another letter to Laurens, Hamilton calls himself, 'a jealous lover.' Men of Jamestown . Even though sodomy was considered taboo at the time, Larry Kramer says that a lack of women in Jamestown led many men to experiment with one another in their absence. 'It's only natural that men would sleep with each other, when there are no women around for months on end,' said Larry Kramer of the initially all male settlement. 'Why is that not in the history books? Because all history books are written by straight people, and they don't wanna either admit that, or they wouldn't know how to recognize what we call 'gaydar.' According to Kramer, Jamestown was a mecca of gay sex where men chose to sleep with men because there weren't any women around. 'It's only natural that men would sleep with each other, when there are no women around for months on end,' said Kramer. Kramer says it took him 40 years to write his 800 page history book that spans from pre-historic america all the way to the 1950s. 'It's called a 'novel,' but that's just to keep the lawyers away from me,' Kramer said. 'I believe everything in the book is true. Everything in there happened,' said Kramer who has long wanted to write a book on gay history. Spurned lover: Larry Kramer claims John Wilkes Booth, who murdered Abraham Lincoln, was one of Lincoln's spurned male lovers . The writer: Larry Kramer, 79, is an HIV positive American writer and gay rights advocate who spent 40 years writing his most recent book . 'It may look like fiction, but to me, it’s not,' Kramer told the New York Times. 'Most histories have been written by straight people. There has never been any history book written where the gay people have been in the history from the beginning.It’s ridiculous to think we haven’t been here for ever.' Kramer says that John Wilkes Booth's murder had nothing to do about the outcome of the Civil war, rather Bookes felt spurned by the president. Kramer's book doesn't only touch on the gay history of politicians but it also talks about the about the HIV crisis in the nation which will be the book's second volume. Kramer, who is HIV positive, said that 35 years is too long for a plague like HIV to still be in existence. 'You'll hear all about the plague of AIDS in the second volume, and a lot about Ronald Reagan,' Kramer said. 'It's not a nice story, but it's one that needs to be told. If I've been kept alive for any reason, it was to tell this story.'

// Article: (CNN)By now, you probably have a position regarding the controversy over Indiana's religious freedom law. You applaud the growing chorus of companies blasting the law as an invitation for businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians, using religion as a cover. Or, like Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, you are surprised at the backlash and maintain that it is basically a copy of a law that is already in the books at the federal level and 19 other states. The issue drives a wedge because, well, the debate over religious freedom and gay rights is always heated, but also because the interpretations and motives behind the law can be questioned. Whichever side you're on, here are five things you might not have considered when thinking about this controversy. These points might not change your mind, but offer context to better understand the uproar. As the author of the 1993 federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), Sen. Chuck Schumer is one who can offer clarity over the controversy surrounding Indiana's version of the law. Schumer mocks Indiana's contention that the state law is simply a mirror of the 22-year-old federal law. "That may be true only if you're using a Funhouse mirror," Schumer wrote on his Facebook page. The federal law was intended to protect individual's religious freedom from government intervention, he said. The Indiana law justifies discrimination in the name of religious freedom, he contends. Also, the law was envisioned to protect the religious freedoms of individuals, while the Indiana law also protects private companies, Schumer said. So, how can the law's supporters claim it is basically a copy of the federal law? If you look at the purpose of the law, the language in the federal and Indiana religious freedom laws are indeed  nearly indistinguishable. In short --  the government cannot interfere with a person's religious practices unless there is a compelling government interest to do so. The uproar is over that fact that the Indiana law expands the reach of the religious protections to include private companies and cases where the government is not involved. Other states previously passed their own version of the religious freedom law -- Indiana became the 20th. But other state laws mirror the federal law much more closely than the Indiana law does. The key difference in the Indiana law is that it expands the instances where someone can use religious freedom as a defense. This is how it could make a difference: . In 2006, Vanessa Willock contacted a photographer about shooting her commitment ceremony with her partner. This was in New Mexico, a state with a religious freedom law at the time of the dispute. The company, Elane Photography, refused the job because of the co-owner's religious beliefs. Willock sued Elane Photography for discrimination, and the company defended itself by citing the law. The photography studio lost the case because the court ruled that it could not use the religious freedom law because the dispute was between two private parties and not a government entity. What would happen if that case happened today in Indiana, with the new, expanded religious freedom law? For sure, the case would have proceeded to trial, said Tim Holbrook, a law professor at Emory University. The photography studio would have had the chance to make its argument in court that it denied the service because of religious reasons. Would the outcome have been the same? Would an Indiana jury side with the company that refused service to a couple because of their sexual orientation? In a letter expressing concern about the Indiana law, a group of 30 legal scholars argued that what Indiana has done is expanded the scope of the law to the point that religious considerations might trump discrimination concerns. "In our expert opinion, the clear evidence ... unmistakably demonstrates that the broad language of the proposed state RFRA will more likely create confusion, conflict, and a wave of litigation that will threaten the clarity of religious liberty rights in Indiana while undermining the state's ability to enforce other compelling interests," the letter, whose signatories included many Indiana law professors, stated. These concerns are based on speculation of what might happen, said Josh Blackman, a constitutional law professor at South Texas College of Law. Yes, the Indiana law makes it clear that individuals and private companies can use the religious freedom law as a defense, he said. "But, just because you raise the defense does not mean it will be successful." Those who try to defend their discriminatory actions in court tend to lose, Blackman said. In his opinion, if Elane Photography had been able to use the law as a defense in New Mexico, it still likely would have lost the case. What's clear is that Indiana's law increases the potential pool of people who can defend themselves claiming religious freedom. The success of such arguments is to be seen. In the meantime, some are already hatching plans on how to test the law, including Bill Levin, founder of The First Church Of Cannabis, who argued on CNN that the law should protect his right to smoke pot. Much is being made of the fact that the first religious freedom law was signed by President Bill Clinton more than 20  years ago. There was bipartisan support in 1993, so why the commotion over a similar law in 2015, some ask? Context, timing and intent have changed the way these laws are viewed. The federal law was written by two Democrats, Schumer and the late Sen. Edward Kennedy. Today, it is being championed by Republicans. The law came into being after two Native Americans in Oregon were fired from their jobs at a rehab clinic because they had consumed peyote, the hallucinogenic cactus. They were denied unemployment benefits, and they sued the state, claiming that the peyote was part of their religious customs. They lost the case. There was outrage over the decision, and the law was created as a remedy. As envisioned by its authors, it would protect the freedoms of religious minorities. Over the years, the law helped a number of people -- a Muslim prisoner won the right to grow a short beard, a Santeria priest was allowed to sacrifice a goat on special religious occasions, and a Native American boy received an exception to his school's policy banning long hair on boys. The law was on the books for years, with little attention paid to it. But Holbrook says it is no coincidence that the religious freedom laws became popular at the state level just as the gay rights and marriage equality movement made historic steps. Many states are using the laws to carve out exceptions to allow Christians to deny services to same-sex couples. Holbrook said. "The timing is beyond a coincidence," he said. "We are having an interest in RFRA at the time same-sex marriage is coming forward." Though not enshrined in the law, critics accuse the states pursuing the laws of using them to justify discrimination by the majority religion. Blackman said the history of the state religious freedom laws shows that they have not turned into conduits for discrimination. The expanded laws might mean more people will defend themselves using it, but most will likely lose, he said. "The moral outrage over this reflects how uninformed people are on the history of the RFRA," he said. So we've established that the biggest difference between the federal law and the Indiana law is the scope: In Indiana, the law can be raised as a defense in private disputes, while the federal law applies only to government matters. Not so fast. According to Blackman, the interpretations of the federal religious freedom law are not uniform. Four U.S. circuit courts of appeals have ruled that the federal law can be used as a defense in cases involving private parties. Two other appeals courts have ruled that this is not allowed. And then, there is the Hobby Lobby case. Hobby Lobby, citing the federal religious freedom law, argued that it should not have to provide contraception coverage through insurance to its employees via Obamacare because it was against the owners' beliefs. And, Hobby Lobby won the case before the Supreme Court. The ruling, in effect, expanded the reach of the federal law to include a business. The Hobby Lobby decision, plus the appeals courts rulings, may have opened the door for states like Indiana to be explicit about its expansion of the law. One way to look at it, Blackman said, is that Indiana simply clarified and codified something that is hazy in the federal courts. The outrage over the Indiana law is that it can be used to deny services to the LGBT community on the ground of religious beliefs. Some may rightfully ask, "Where was the outrage before the religious freedom law?" Indiana does not have an nondiscrimination law that protects people based on sexual orientation or gender identity. In that sense, the religious freedom law is not necessary for those who want to discriminate against gays and lesbians. Even before the controversial Indiana law was passed, if a restaurant denied service to a gay couple, the couple might be able to sue, but not for discrimination. For that matter, there is also no federal law that protects the LGBT community. According to the Human Rights Campaign, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people are sometimes fired, denied a promotion or harassed in the workplace. And their recourse is limited. With the proliferation of religious freedom state laws, nondiscrimination laws become even more important. Another hypothetical outcome of the New Mexico case involving the lesbian couple and the photography studio. If New Mexico had the same religious freedom law as Indiana, the case would have gone to trial. But New Mexico has a nondiscrimination law that protects the LGBT community, it and it would have provided a strong counter-argument to the religious freedom claim. In Indiana, that protection would be lacking. (It gets more complicated when some local governments, like the city of Indianapolis, do have nondiscrimination ordinances). For this reason, Holbrook suggests that a "fix" for the Indiana law would be the passage of a nondiscrimination law. Or, at the very least, an exception written into the religious freedom bill that protects from such discrimination.

Article: New York Police Commissioner Bill Bratton swooned over the 'boy band' of four Swedish cops who broke up a subway fight in The Big Apple this week, complimenting their use of safe and effective restraint tactics. Tourist police officers Samuel Kvarzell, Markus Asberg, Eric Jansberger and Erik Naslund halted a fight between two homeless men on the Uptown 6 train this Wednesday. A video of the selfless act then surfaced and has spread on social media, gaining them attention from hoards of fans, both male and female. Officials from the United States and Sweden have praised their brave efforts and they are set to return home as heroes. Scroll down for video . Giving thanks: New York Police Commissioner Bill Bratton (center) thanked four Swedish cops who broke up a subway fight in The Big Apple this week . 'I would like to acknowledge them. There’s been a lot of attention paid to them, appropriately so, over the last day or so: a New York Post story and some other coverage,' Bratton said on Friday. 'Gentlemen, thank you very, very much. You did a great honor to yourselves, certainly to your police service and to your country. We appreciate all the help we can get,' he said. 'Here as tourists, they stepped up,' he added. The New York Post reports that the techniques employed by the Swedish men are in line with what the NYPD teaches their police officers. The physical force they employed is not intended to hurt the individual they are restraining and is still very effective. 'I was noticing that the moves that they made are very much the same moves that we now teach our young people at the academy in terms of how to take people down in a way trying to ensure that they’re not injured during that apprehension,' Bratton said with pride. Bratton presented the men with medallions. When the four men return to Sweden they will be awarded at a lunch with Sweden's minister for home affairs Anders Ygema. 'The minister has invited the police officers to the government office for lunch once they get back to Sweden,' spokesman Fredrik Persson said. Earlier this week officer Asberg said what he and his friends did was 'no big deal.' Bratton disagrees with him and commends their actions. '[They] found themselves involved a situation on the subway where they activated themselves as police officers,' Bratton said. '‎We very much appreciate that,' he said. 'We're no heroes, just tourists': The Swedish cops (pictured left to right) Erik Näslund, 26, Samuel Kvarzell, 25, Makrus Åsberg, 25, and Eric Jansberger, 28, said they were just answering the call of duty . The Swedish friends were on their way to see Les Misérables on Broadway on Wednesday, DNA Info reports, and rushed in to stop a brutal assault on a crowded rush-hour 6 train. 'We came here for vacation. We’ve been here one day. We’re no heroes, just tourists,' Makrus Åsberg, a 25-year-old officer with the police Uppsala, Sweden, told the New York Post. Mr Asberg, along with Erik Naslund, Samuel Kvarzell and Eric Jansberger, subdued an enraged homeless man who was viciously beating another rider on the train. The Samaritan Scandinavians stopped the violence and held the attacker until the NYPD could arrive, the Post reports. Video from the incident shows Kvarzell and Asberg holding the suspect down and trying to calm him down as he screams. 'I can't breath! I can't breath!' he screams. 'Take it easy, just calm down,' Asberg tells him. The friends sprang into action after a frantic conductor yelled over the intercom: 'Are there any police officers on the train?' As the train pulled into the Bleeker Street station, the Nordic lawmen found a homeless man pummeling another rider in the next car. Three of the Swedes tended to the aggressor (background) and held him for police, while the fourth stayed with the victim, who had been badly beaten in the fight . The Nordic tourists kept both men calm until NYPD cops showed up to sort out the scene . The victim had a bloody mouth and seemed to be badly beaten and was not defending himself the Swedes told the Post. One of the officers put the attacker in an arm lock, while two others held him down to the floor of the train. 'One of the guys tried to wrestle us so [we] wrestled him to the floor until the police came,' Kvarzell, 25, who is also an officer, told DNA Info. 'We don't have authority or anything but we thought somebody might need help,' he said. When NYPD officers showed up, they took custody of the aggressor and the four tourists went on their way to Les Misérables. Markus Asberg (left) and Samuel Kvarzell (right) stepped in to stop a brutal beating on a New York subway train along with two other friends, all of whom are police officers in their native Sweden . Eric Jansberger (left) and Erik Naslund (right) had only just arrived in New York and were on their way to see Les Misérables on Broadway when they answered the call of duty .

// Article: They have a reputation as rather brutish creatures who chomped their way through huge hunks of meat, but it seems Neanderthals may actually have been the first masterchefs. New research is suggesting that these extinct early humans may have used wild herbs to flavour their food. Scientists have found traces of compounds found in camomile and yarrow in the hardened plaque of 50,000 year old Neanderthal teeth found in El Sidron, Spain. Neanderthals (represented in the drawing above) may have been the world's first gourmets - using herbs like yarrow and camomile to flavour the meat that dominated their diet, according to a new scientific paper . At first researchers thought they might have been using these plants as a form of self-medication, but now new findings have presented a different theory. Dr Sabrina Krief, a lecturer at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, and her colleagues suggests they may have used them to make food more palatable. Neanderthals may have cooked stews in the skins of animals, according to some anthropologists. Animal bones found at sites known to have been inhabited by Neanderthals are 90 per cent free of gnaw marks. This suggests that fat and meat had instead been cooked off the bones. A study of tooth plaque from the teeth of fossilised Neanderthal remains also suggest that they may have heated grains of barley. However, there is no evidence that Neanderthals had any pots or pans to cook with. Instead Professor John Speth, an archaeologist at the University of Michigan, believes that they used animal paunches and folded bark to make bags that they could boil their good in. A study of plaque found on Neanderthal teeth like the one above suggests they ate grains like barley . They have found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda eat three different types of leaf while consuming meat they had caught. They say Neanderthals could also used herbs to improve their culinary creations in the same way. There is already evidence that they cooked their food and may even have created stews in the skins of animals. Writing in the journal Antiquity, Dr Krief and her colleagues said: 'Data on Neanderthal behaviour suggest that their subsistence and technological strategies were complex.' Neanderthals have long been portrayed as a rather primitive form of human that died out as they were unable to compete with the more sophisticated modern humans that arrived in Europe and Asia from Africa. However, recent discoveries have shown that they may actually have had a complex culture - capable of making stone tools and even jewellery. Three years ago researchers at the University of Barcelona examined ten teeth from the remains of five Neanderthals found in El Sidron, northern Spain. In the dental plaque of one young adult they discovered three compounds that occur naturally in yarrow and camomile. Dr Karen Hardy and her team, who conducted that work, suggested that these plants had been used to help ward off illness or treat a diease. Yarrow for example has been used in the past to treat fever and to stem bleeding. However it was also a popular vegetable in the 17th century, while the leaves can also be dried and used as a herb. It is said to produce a pungent odour while having a slightly sweet and peppery taste that has been described as similar to spinach. Camomile was also a popular treatment for inflammation, hayfever and stomach problems, but is still used to today to flavour foods in top restaurants. Neither of the plants have much nutritional value but both convey strong flavours. Dr Krief and her team found that separate groups of chimpanzees at Budongo Forest Reserve and Kibale National Park ate plants while chewing meat. New archaeological discoveries are expanding our knowledge of how Neanderthals lived in ways that could not have been imagined when their fossilised remains, like the skeleton above, were first found by archaeologists . Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay has become well known for his subtle use of flavours that contrasts with his rather brutish approach in the kitchen, but it seems he could also have learned some tips from Neanderthals . Neanderthals, like the one shown above, may well have been the world's first gourmet chefs, findings suggest . They reason that if this was for medicinal purposes, different animals would eat different plants depending on their ailments. However, the animals in each group all tended to eat the same plants with their meat, suggesting they were eating them for flavour instead. Dr Krief said that previous work has dismissed the idea that Neanderthals were eating herbs to flavour food based on the assumption that their tastes were very basic. However, she says that if chimpanzees use plants to flavour their food, then it is entirely possible that Neanderthals also used herbs and spices. Writing in Antiquity, the researchers said: 'The strong, bitter taste of the leaves may modify the flavour of the viscera, muscles, organs or water. 'In a French cookbook, a recipe proposes cooking a blanquette of veal with camomile. 'The bitter taste of the cooked plant does not necessarily disappear completely; camomile, for example, remains bitter when infused. 'The presence of cooked carbohydrates, esters, phenols, pyrene and florathene in calculus samples from El Sidron supports the hypothesis that Neanderthals were cooking plant food and perhaps smoking food, confirming that they were able to practice different food-processing techniques. 'It is suggested that, among other cooking methods, roasting, heating or even potentially boiling to make soup, stew or stock might have been used by Neanderthals. 'Such a variety of practices, combined with the fact that the samples from El Sidr´on reveal the presence of smoke-related compounds, show that Neanderthals were using food processing at least as complex as flavouring food with plant material.' Other recent discoveries are starting to reveal what culinary creatures the Neanderthals were. Camomile is well known as a herb that can produce some interesting flavours for dishes and was eaten by Neanderthals according to recent research on dental plaque that had hardened onto fossiled teeth . Yarrow is a hardy plant but its leaves can be used as a herb known for its sweet flavour and bitter aftertaste . Research presented at the Paleoanthropology Society Annual Meeting this week suggests they tended to eat horses, deer and bovids rather than larger game like mammoths. According to New Scientist, Geoff Smith, from the Monrepos Archaeological Research Centre in Germany, said they also seemed to have sucked out the fatty marrow from bones. There is also some evidence from Neanderthal sites in Gibralter that suggests they also liked nuts and wild olives. Analysis of fossilised Neanderthal faeces has also revealed that while they ate meat, they also had a 'significant intake of plants'. Dr Simon Underdown, an anthropologist at Oxford Brookes University, said: 'This paper reminds us that the Neanderthals were complicated and sophisticated humans. 'While the data from dental calculus might be evidence for medicinal plants this new research highlights a number of alternative explanations; the most intriguing of which is the use of food flavourings. 'The comparison with chimps must be used carefully as they are a very different animal but the complex array of behaviours seen in world chimps gives us even more to marvel at when we think about what the Neanderthals were capable of.' Neanderthals first emerged around 280,000 years ago, spreading to inhabit much of Europe and parts of Asia, but they eventually died out 40,000 years ago. The reason for their demise was often put down to being a more primative species of human that was unable to compete against the more sophisticated Homo sapiens. They were depicted as thuggish cavemen that scraped an existence on the cold lands of ice age Europe. However, a series of discoveries are now putting Neanderthals into a new light. Stone tools discovered at sites they inhabited suggest they were skilled tool makers with adept hand eye coordination. A 60,000-year-old multi-purpose bone tool unearthed in France also suggests Neanderthals understood how to use bones to make useful devices . A recent discovery by researchers at the Muséum National d'Histories Naturelle in Paris suggests that Neanderthals may have built homes using the materials they found around them. They discovered a 26 feet wide building created 44,000 years ago from mammoth bones. Many of the bones had also been decorated carvings and ochre pigments. Cross-hatched engravings found inside Gorham's Cave in Gibraltar are also thought to be the first known examples of Neanderthal rock art. DNA analysis has also shown that Neanderthals carried the same genes that are thought to have enabled modern humans to speak. Eight talons found at a 130,000 year old Neanderthal site in Krapina in Croatia are also thought to be the world's first jewellery, and may have been worn as a necklace. The traditional image of Neanderthals as primitive creatures like above is no longer holding up to evidence .

Alison Saunders, 54, sparked outrage last week when she decided  the 86-year-old should not face a string of charges of paedophilia against nine children because he has dementia. Today, newly-released documents revealed damning evidence that abuse was covered up by police and social workers for more than 20 years. And now it has emerged Mrs Saunders' law career got off to a flying start when she secured her pupillage – a barrister’s training contract at 1 Garden Court Chambers in London in 1983. It has been revealed that the country's top prosecutor Alison Saunders (right) who ruled that Lord Janner (right) would not face trial over alleged child sex abuse trained at the same legal firm where he was a QC . Last night, The Sun revealed that Mrs Saunders trained in the same in legal chambers where Lord Janner had practised. The Bar Council, the training body for barristers, confirmed Janner worked at the legal firm from the mid-1950s up until 1986. But a spokesperson for the CPS insisted the pair had never met, despite a three-year overlap of their time at the firm. She told MailOnline: ‘It is common knowledge that Alison Saunders had her pupillage at Garden Court chambers. 'But the DPP and Lord Janner have never met. This is ridiculous.’ The chambers were Saunders and Janner practised at 1 Garden Court was dissolved in 1989. Since then, a different and unconnected family law chambers has operated from the same address. By Richard Marsden for the Daily Mail . Alison Saunders graduated in law from Leeds University in 1982 and was called to the Bar in the following year. Her pupillage – a barrister’s training contract – was at 1 Garden Court Chambers, the same offices where Lord Janner practised employment law. She joined the Crown Prosecution Service in 1986, after which she shaped policy on child victims. In 2001, she became chief prosecutor for Sussex and oversaw the prosecution of paedophile Roy Whiting for the abduction and murder of Sarah Payne. After a short time as deputy legal adviser to the attorney general from 2003, she returned to the CPS two years later to set up its organised crime division. In 2009, she became chief crown prosecutor for London and then Director of Public Prosecutions in November 2013. Now, the country's top prosecutor is facing calls to quit from campaigners and alleged abuse victims. Pete Saunders, director of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said the revelation is 'an insult' to survivors of abuse. He told The Sun: 'On the evidence how can we not conclude that they might be covering for each other. Lord Janner (pictured after being sworn in as a Queen's Counsel in 1971) worked at Garden Court Chambers from the mid-1950s until 1986 . It is scandalous and an insult to to all the survivors who have spent decades fighting to get themselves heard.' The Crown Prosecution Service concluded there was enough evidence to charge Janner with 22 offences from 1969 and 1998. While admitting that dementia is not 'a bar' to prosecution, Mrs Saunders has defended her decision not to bring charges against Janner, adding she was surprised at the political backlash she has faced. Janner’s family have issued a statement insisting he was ‘entirely innocent of any wrongdoing’ - but he has been suspended from the Labour Party. ‘Dementia in itself isn’t a bar to either a trial or to a trial of the facts, but you have to look at – and the law is very clear about this – is there a need to have a trial on the facts for the public protection?’ she told the BBC. ‘In many of the cases where we do use that procedure, it’s because there’s an ongoing risk to the public. Again the medical evidence was very clear in this case: there was no ongoing risk.’ But her links to the shamed peer come as it emerged the judge tasked with reviewing the mistakes that prevented Janner from being brought to trial in the past was a close friend of the barrister hired to defend Janner against claims of abuse. Lord Janner turned to the late George Carman QC - who also represented paedophile Jimmy Savile - when he was first investigated in 1991. Sir Richard Henriques considered Mr Carman a mentor at the Bar, The Times reported. But Mrs Saunders has insisted that  Sir Richard's friendship with Mr Carman would have no influence on the review.

Article: It wouldn’t make much of a breakfast, but this tiny egg could give a schoolgirl and her pet hens a place in the Guinness Book of Records. Shannon Hayes, 12, believes one of them has laid the smallest chicken egg in the world. After doing some research on the internet, she thinks its length of 1.8cm – smaller than a 5p coin – shaves two millimetres off the previous title-holder. Shannon said: ‘I’m confident it’s the smallest. It is very tiny and you wouldn’t want it for breakfast.’ Shannon Hayes, centre, believes her pet hen, right, has laid the world's smallest ever egg, left . The tiny egg, left,  is only a small fraction of the normal size of the traditional breakfast favourite, right . The tiny egg, which was laid in Capel Iwan, Carmarthenshire, is smaller than a five pence piece, pictured . She keeps seven hens at her family home in Capel Iwan, Carmarthenshire, but she is not sure which laid the tiny egg. Shannon spotted it among the ordinary-sized eggs in her hen coop. Fearful of it being crushed, she immediately took it into the house to be measured. In 2011, an American farmer claimed his hen had laid the world’s smallest chicken egg, measuring 2.1cm long. That was beaten in 2014 by an egg one millimetre smaller laid in Somerset by a hen called Muffin. Meanwhile, Shannon is storing her potential world record-breaker it in the fridge for safe-keeping. Shannon believes that her egg, which measures just 1.8cm in length is 3mm smaller than the current record .

Article: (CNN)The accidental death of a 2-year-old boy in Milwaukee on Sunday triggered a violent chain of events, eventually claiming the lives of three more people. It all started with a birthday party that little Damani Terry was attending. During the family gathering, he dashed out into the street and was struck and killed by a GMC van, according to Milwaukee police. The distraught driver, Archie Brown Jr., 40, immediately stopped and got out to tend to the boy. But it was too late, police said. Damani was dead. Damani's alarmed family came running, including his older brother, 15-year-old Rasheed Chiles, police said. That was not the end of the situation. Soon, two more people would also die: the driver and the teen were both felled by bullets fired by the same man, police said. That man, identified as Ricky Ricardo Chiles III, was located late Wednesday at a Chicago-area hotel. He committed suicide as authorities closed in with a warrant for his arrest, Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn told reporters. "Chicago police and United States Marshals Service entered the hotel room, whereupon Mr. Chiles took his own life with his firearm," the police chief said Thursday. An accidental death, a fatal retaliation rips apart two families . Damani's family members had previously identified the shooting suspect as the boys' uncle. "Sunday was the worst day I ever lived in my whole entire life," Lena Tidwell, told CNN affiliate WISN. "It's a day I wish had never, never came." Tidwell is the boys' grandmother and the mother of the alleged gunman. She said she was inside eating cake and ice cream at the birthday when her life turned upside down. "I didn't know my grandbaby got hit, and then I heard people just screaming," she said. "Then I just heard gunshots, and my daughter ran in the house with the baby in her arms." The family believes the uncle targeted Brown, and Rasheed was struck by an errant bullet. "I heard he was trying to pick his brother up. He was trying to hold him and save him," a family friend, Stephanie Townsend, told CNN affiliate WITI. Earlier this week, Flynn bemoaned the apparent madness of what happened. "What did we have Sunday?" Flynn asked. "We had some clown take the law into his own hands and murder a guy who was doing what we expect good citizens to do, and oops, accidentally kill somebody else."

Article: A passenger plane trying to land at a Texas airport turned back when the pilot discovered that the runway lights had been switched off. American Eagle Flight 2536 was scheduled to fly about 125 miles from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport to Wichita Falls, Texas, on Sunday night. The plane left nearly a half-hour late, and when it got to Wichita Falls, the pilot told passengers that the runway lights were turned off and there was nobody at the airport to turn them on, according to officials in the city of 100,000 people. Plane: American Eagle Flight 2536 was scheduled to fly about 125 miles from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport to Wichita Falls, Texas, on Sunday night (file photo) Wichita Falls officials first said that the Eagle pilot had the wrong radio frequency to turn on the lights on the main, 13,000-foot runway. Like many other small airports where control towers are not staffed around the clock, pilots in Wichita Falls can operate the runway lights with their radio system. But on Tuesday, city aviation director John Burrus said that Sheppard Air Force Base, which shares the facility, had closed the runway and turned off the lights. Burrus said Sheppard notified pilots of the closure. He added that the American Eagle jet could have landed on an adjacent, 10,000-foot runway that was lit. A spokesman for ExpressJet, a regional carrier that operated the flight under contract with American Airlines, said late Tuesday that the airline was still trying to determine what happened. 'The pilot attempted to activate the lights, but he couldn't do so,' said Jarek Beem, the ExpressJet spokesman. He said he didn't know why the pilot didn't land on the shorter runway. 'We're still reviewing the entire incident.' Beem said the pilot circled Wichita Falls for about 30 minutes before giving up and turning back to DFW. The plane, with 45 passengers, made an otherwise uneventful midnight landing at DFW after a one hour, 40-minute flight, according to tracking service FlightAware.com. Wichita Falls officials first said that the American Eagle pilot had the wrong radio frequency to turn on the lights on the main, 13,000-foot runway (file photo)

Article: (CNN)They used to do the guarding at Florida prisons. Now they're the ones behind bars. Two Florida corrections officers and one former officer trainee have been charged in a plot to kill a former inmate who was getting out of prison, the Florida Attorney General's office said Thursday. An FBI informant met the men -- Thomas Jordan Driver, 25; David Elliot Moran, 47; and Charles Thomas Newcomb, 42 -- after infiltrating a branch of the KKK:  the Traditional American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, CNN affiliate WJXT reported. Driver told the informant that he had gotten into a fight with the inmate and that he and Moran wanted him "six feet under," according to court documents. To convince the suspects that the deed had been done, the FBI staged a fake homicide scene with the former inmate and took pictures to show them that he had been killed. "When the FBI staged this crime scene and these photographs were shown to each of these men, they were happy about it," said Statewide Prosecutor Nick Cox. The three men are now facing up to 30 years in jail if convicted on one count each of conspiracy to commit murder. "We will not tolerate nor will we ever remain silent over the violence of hatred embedded in prejudice in this country," Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi said. CNN's Joe Sutton contributed to this report.

Article: (CNN)Chile's Calbuco volcano erupted twice in 24 hours, the country's National Geology and Mining Service said early Thursday. The agency said it was evaluating the spectacular nighttime eruption, but indicated it was "stronger than the first one." About 23½ inches (60 centimeters) of ash fell in some places, according to the Ministry of Interior and Public Safety. Authorities issued a red alert for the towns of Puerto Montt and Puerto Varas in southern Chile. Both are popular tourist destinations. A 12-mile (20 kilometer) exclusion zone was established around the crater. Military and police forces were assisting with the evacuations of more than 4,400 residents, the Interior Ministry said. The first eruption on Wednesday set off a bit of a panic in the region. "At the beginning, it was small, and later, the cloud grew and later there was a huge cloud over you and true terror starts," said one Puerto Montt resident. Another person said: "It was impressive to see an enormous mushroom cloud, with the immense force of the volcano, and to see the ashes. At that point, there was a lot of panic, lots of chaos, traffic jams, people going to supermarkets, everyone looking for water, trying to take out money from the ATMs." The eruption is a first for many in the region. The last major eruption was 1962.  There was a minor eruption in 1972. Calbuco also belched out a bit of gas and smoke in 1996. Alejandro Verges, regional director at the Ministry of Interior and Public Safety, said Thursday afternoon that officials are concerned there might be a third eruption. "The situation is relatively calm right now, although people are understandably anxious about what could happen tonight," he said.

Article: Fifteen-times grand slam champion Martina Hingis made a courageously impressive return to big-time singles tennis in the Fed Cup on Saturday but was eventually outplayed by Agnieszka Radwanska. Hingis was persuaded to play her first tour-level singles for nearly eight years because of injuries in the Switzerland team for the World Group playoff encounter against Poland. The 34-year-old brought back memories of her heyday in a thrilling 48-minute first set before capitulating 6-4 6-0 to world number nine Radwanska after 76 enjoyable minutes. Martina Hingis fought courageously but could not prevent defeat on her first return to singles since 2007 . The former World No 1 was defeated 6-4, 6-0 by Agnieszka Radwanska (right) in the Fed Cup . Hingis was persuaded to play because of injuries in the team and to secure a spot on the Olympic team . Australian Open  (1997, 1998, 1999) Wimbledon (1997) US Open (1997) French Open runner-up (1997, 1999) Total career singles titles: 43 . Total career doubles titles: 44 . Career prize money: $20,974,066 . Smiling a lot and clearly enjoying the experience of being back in the spotlight against a player with a similarly attractive style, Hingis played some exhilarating tennis early on but her effort eventually took its toll. Half a step slower in the second set, she could only win 11 points as Radwanska upped her game to give Poland a 1-0 lead in the tie. What was most eye-catching was the way Hingis fought in the opening set, twice coming back from a break down to level the scores until the pressure exerted by Radwanska finally told. Hingis, who only plays doubles on tour those days, was making a Fed Cup return for the first time since the 1998 final because she has to play in the competition to qualify for next year's Olympics. Hingis lines up with team-mates including (L-R) Romina Oprandi, Victorija Golubic and Timea Bacsinszky .

Article: Garnet has been abandoned for almost 100 years. The tiny Montana outpost was established in the 1860s by miners looking for gold and silver, but it was devastated by fire around 1912 and deserted a few years later. While the town has since been restored, it remains empty, and local folklore says the area is haunted by former residents, with visitors saying they heard music and laughter, even in winter, and the sound of doors slamming in cottages where there aren't any doors. Now the U.S. Bureau of Land Management is offering free food, housing a job to people willing to live in Garnet and work as a tour operator, as the government prepares the village to become a new tourist stop. Scroll down for video . Ghost town coming back to life: The former mining town of Garnet in Montana was deserted after a fire in 1912. It is said to be haunted by some of its former residents, but is now set to boom once again and become a new tourist mecca. But workers are need to operate the place . New hot spot: The U.S. Bureau of Land Management in Missoula is offering free food, housing a job to people willing to live in Garnet and work as a tour operator, as the government prepares the village to become a new tourist stop. Creepy: Local folklore says the area is haunted by former residents, with visitors saying they heard music and laughter, even in winter, and the sound of doors slamming in cottages where there aren't any doors . Abandoned: Garnet was restored after half the town was devastated by fire, but it remains deserted, even though there is a mine nearby . Ghostly: Locals say the spirits come out around midnight. Garnet has no electricity, so the new workers might be in for a fright . There are four positions, with some workers operating as tour guides and others keeping the grounds. The job ad was first posted in local newspaper The Missoulian, expecting to only find interest from within Montana . It stressed there was no electricity or plumbing. Regardless, the story was almost immediately shared 32,000 on Facebook. The following day, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management's office in Missoula was inundated with calls and emails. 'The calls came in almost immediately,' BLM spokeswoman Maria Craig told The Missoulian. 'Garnet Ghost Town Ranger Nacoma Gainan told me the next morning he already had 130 emails and he didn't know how many phone calls. The phone was ringing all morning. 'We got people asking about it from South Africa, from China, the United Kingdom, Germany and all over the country.' 'There were more out-of-state people than Montanans calling.' Help wanted: The U.S. Bureau of Land Management is looking for volunteers to help manage Garnet Ghost Town, a Montana mining town more that's more than 100 years old, and has been mostly abandoned for nearly that long . Spooky: Garnet isn't a ghost town in name only: Rumors abound of real-life hauntings . Vacancies: The workers to volunteer to run Garnet will be put up in one of the cottages to live . Preparing: Once a mining town with a population of 1,000, Garnet is set to boom again as a tourist stop . Craig said that the working day wraps about 4.30pm, with the tourists leaving, giving the workers plenty of time to settle in before nightfall. She added that the job applications have now closed due to the overwhelming response, but was not clear whether the positions had been filled. Ellen Baumler, the Montana Historic Society's expert on all things creature comforts, wrote in her book, Montana Chillers, that the ghosts of Garnet would come out at midnight. She said people had reported the sound of a piano and that winter visitors had seen visions, according to The Bulletin Standard. 'Late at evening, the spirits of Garnet arrive out to enjoy in the moonlight,' Baumler wrote. 'Sometimes, in the deep wintertime silent, a piano tinkles in Kelley's Saloon and the spirits dance to ghostly new music. 'Men's voices echo in the empty rooms. But the moment a living, human hand touches the building, the noises stop.' Chilling: Interestingly, most of the spooky stories that surround Garnet have been reported in the winter . Janet Goodall, of Buffalo, New York, has worked at the Garnet visitor information center. She told Fox News it was more just strange things occurring rather than ghosts that she heard in her time there. 'I've seen visitors become friendly and helpful when unexpected things happen, like flat tires, empty gas tanks, keys locked in cars, minor injuries, and in one case, a diabetic faint,' she told the network.

// Article: Iran's President Hassan Rouhani (above) has pledged to abide by the commitments of a nuclear agreement that promises to end years of crippling sanctions . Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has pledged to abide by the commitments of a nuclear agreement that promises to end years of crippling sanctions. Residents danced in the streets, blared their horns and joyously waved their national flag following the breakthrough deal. The agreement between Iran and the West, struck after a 12-year stand-off, aims to prevent Tehran making a nuclear weapon in exchange for phased sanction relief. Mr Rouhani also called on world powers to fulfil their part of the deal. Speaking after the announcement he said: 'Everything we promised in the nuclear talks ... we will remain loyal to and stand by our promises. 'The world must know that we do not intend to cheat.' David Cameron and Barack Obama insisted the deal was 'strong'. The marathon talks between Iran and the US, UK, France, China, Russia and Germany in Lausanne, on the shores of Lake Geneva, had run over their deadline by more than two days with many fearing a deal was not possible. But last night, the EU's foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini announced Iran had agreed to restrictions on its enrichment of material that can be used either for energy production or in nuclear warheads. Under its terms, Iran would scale down plans to enrich uranium and make weapons-grade plutonium in return for Western powers dropping stringent economic sanctions. They will also be subjected to inspections. If they are found to be in violation of the terms, the sanctions will be put back in place. Iranians celebrated in Tehran last night after a historic deal was struck between Iran and six world powers . The deal promises to end years of crippling sanctions against Iran and locals could not contain their joy . Mohammad Javad Zarif milks the applause of the crowd after securing the agreement in Lausanne . A man holds up a £5 note out of his car to mark the lifting of stringent sanctions on Iran last night . The powers hope the deal will make it virtually impossible for Iran to make nuclear weapons under the guise of its civilian programme. Iran and the six world powers must now finalise the deal by June 30. Negotiations on a comprehensive deal will begin in days. After learning that economic and financial sanctions will be rolled back, Iranians danced in the streets, flashing victory signs and brandishing US dollar notes. In Tehran, there were jubilant scenes as locals - many hanging out of cars - celebrated by unfurling national flags and punching their fists in celebration. A new chapter of 'cooperation with the world' will begin when the final deal goes into effect after July, Mr Rouhani said. He said: 'Our enrichment and entire nuclear technology is only for the development of Iran. It will not be against regional countries or against the world. There were joyous scenes in Tehran last night as Iranians waved flags and gave the victory salute . Iranians flash the victory sign from their car while celebrating the breakthrough deal in Switzerland last night . The plans agreed in Switzerland lay the ground for a new relationship between Iran and the six world powers . Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, arriving home, called the agreement a 'win-win outcome' Crucially for Iranians, economic and financial sanctions relating to its nuclear programmes will be rolled back . 'Some think we have no option except to fight the world or to surrender. But there is a third way, too. We have to have cooperation with the world.' Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was mobbed by ecstatic supporters as he arrived at the Mehrabad airport in Tehran after securing the historic deal in Switzerland. He reassured Iranians that the country's nuclear programme will continue but said any negotiation requires give and take. He said: 'Our programme is exclusively peaceful, has always been and always will remain exclusively peaceful. 'Our facilities will continue. We will continue enriching, we will continue research and development.' He added a planned heavy water reactor will be 'modernised' and that the Iranians would keep their deeply buried underground facility at Fordo. 'We have taken a major step but are still some way away from where we want to be', Mr Zarif said, adding that the preliminary step was a 'win-win outcome'. Tuned in: Philip Hammond said the deal would 'provide reassurance that the programme is peaceful' This map helps demonstrate how Iran's nuclear programme is spread across the country - the agreement hopes to prevent Tehran making a nuclear weapon . A Tehran resident, Alireza, 37, told CNN: 'Things can't get worse than they are so, I'm happy with this news. 'This is pretty historic and I pray that my children will be able to live in an Iran that can play nice with the international community.' But the news was not welcomed by all, with Iran's hard-liners describing it as a disaster for Iran. Hossein Shariatmadari, an adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and editor of the hard-line Kayhan daily, said Iran had exchanged its 'ready-to-race horse with a broken bridle'. On a visit to Chorley today, the Prime Minister hailed the 'strong' deal struck in Lausanne. Mr Cameron said: 'I believe this is a great deal and a strong deal. We are all concerned about Iran getting nuclear weapons but what this deal does is block all the pathways to a nuclear weapon, and then have proper inspection and verification. 'Crucially the sanctions that have done so much to bring Iran back to the table, they don't come off unless Iran implements its side.' Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the deal would 'provide reassurance that the programme is peaceful'. Chinese Ambassador to the UN Wu Hailong, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, German Foreign Minister Frank Walter Steinmeier, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarifat, an unidentified Russian official, British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond and US Secretary of State John Kerry, who secured the preliminary agreement in Lausanne . From left Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond speaks to US Secretary of State John Kerry as European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarifat take their positions before making a statement on the Iranian deal . 'This is well beyond what many of us thought possible even 18 months ago and a good basis for what I believe could be a very good deal,' he said last night. 'But there is still more work to do. The fine detail of any deal will be very important, in particular specifics of oversight measures and mechanisms for handling UN Security Council resolutions. 'Diplomats and technical experts from all sides will work intensively over the coming weeks to finalise the detail by the end of June. Sanctions will remain in place until the comprehensive deal is agreed and implemented.' He added: 'Talks were extremely tough. We always said we would never agree a bad deal. This outcome is testament to the persistence and willingness of all sides to be flexible in finding solutions to seemingly intractable problems. 'It demonstrates what can be achieved when international partners work together in pursuit of a common goal.' Speaking at the White House Rose Garden, Mr Obama said that 'if Iran cheats, the world will know it' Mr Obama staked the reputation of his administration on reaching what many believed was an unlikely deal . Mr Obama urged a more cautious note following the breakthrough. Speaking in the White House Rose Garden yesterday, he said: 'If we can get this done, and Iran follows through on the framework that our negotiators agreed to, we will be able to resolve one of the greatest threats to our security, and to do so peacefully. But, he added: 'If Iran cheats, the world will know it.' And 'If there is backsliding' and Iran doesn't meet certain specifications 'there will be no deal.' US Secretary of State John Kerry admitted there was still progress to be made when the deal was signed. He said: 'We have no illusions about the fact that we have a ways to travel. We still have many technical details that have to be addressed.' Following the deal, Israeli leaders immediately raised concerns, vowing to fight any agreement before it is finalized in the coming months. Benjamin Netanyahu slammed the Iran nuclear deal, claiming it threatens the Jewish state and puts his people in mortal danger . One of Netanyahu's scathing comments was shared on his Twitter page during his speech . Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been a leading critic of the nuclear talks, stressing he believes it will leave too much of Iran's nuclear infrastructure intact. After speaking to the US President on the phone, he said in a televised statement just hours after the agreement was signed: 'A deal based on this framework would threaten the survival of Israel.' He added: 'Such a deal would not block Iran's path to the bomb. It would pave it.' It prompted Netanyahu to urge more pressure to be placed on Iran by Western powers until a better deal is reached. Israel's Intelligence Minister Yuval Steinitz, who oversees the monitoring of the nuclear programme, claimed the deal was 'disconnected from the sad reality' of the region. He added: 'Since the declaration is far from being a real agreement, we will continue in our efforts to explain and persuade the world in the hope of preventing a bad agreement, or at least to insert corrections and improvements.' The preliminary agreement announced in Switzerland on Thursday is spelled out in a four-page document (below) released by the White House and the State Department. Here's some of what Iran is agreeing to do: . In return, the West will: . Obama insisted that: 'If Iran cheats, the world will know it'. He added if Tehran didn't meet certain conditions there would be no deal .

Article: Kitted out: Mr Carney out running in Hyde Park . Just how many water bottles does a man need when running? If you’re the governor of the Bank of England, the answer seems to be four. Mark Carney was spotted on a day off from helping to run the economy jogging in London’s Hyde Park sporting a high-tech running belt with no fewer than four water bottles. The keen runner, who training for the London Marathon later this month, was wearing a Nathan Speed 4 Fuel Belt, which also features a zip pocket perfect for storing high-carb energy gel packs. The belt is available for $64.95 (£35) at Kintec, a Canadian sports retailer based in Vancouver, suggesting Mr Carney, originally from Canada, bought it before he moved to the UK. He was also wearing headphones and top-of-the range running shoes. His adidas Energy Boost ESM Shoes, in green and black, cost £120. According to the manufacturer, ‘more boost beneath your feet means more fuel in your tank’. They feature a ‘form-fitting techfit® upper’ which is ‘engineered for natural, flexible support and a seamless, sock-like fit’, the firm’s website states. Mr Carney, in charge of the world’s sixth largest economy, completed his look with a grey jumper, which was drenched in sweat by the end of his training session. The father of four daughters, who turned 50 last week, is known to be a keen sportsman and likes to keep fit. At Harvard, he played in goal for his ice hockey team. In 2011, he completed in Canada’s Ottawa marathon, finishing the 26.2-mile sprint in just three hours and 48 minutes in 2011 – an hour and 40 minutes shy of the winning time that year. He continued running when he moved to London to become the Bank of England chief in 2013, and is known to sometimes run from his home to Bank’s headquarters in the City of London to avoid the traffic. ‘Like many other Londoners I do run to work or home from work from time to time,’ he said in an interview. He will be running the London Marathon in aid of Cancer Research UK, a Bank of England spokesman announced in January. The original: Adam West sports his Batman utility belt in this shot from the popular Sixties TV series .

Article: Aaron Hernandez saw his PCP-taking friends kill Odin Lloyd but did not commit the murder himself, his defense claimed in the closing arguments of his trial on Tuesday. 'Did he make all the right decisions? No,' defense attorney James Sultan said. 'He was a 23-year-old kid who witnessed... a shocking killing committed by somebody he knew. He really didn't know what to do. So he just put one foot in front of the other.' After closing arguments from the defense and the prosecution, the jury began their deliberations on Tuesday afternoon. If convicted, Hernandez faces a maximum penalty of life in prison. The former New England Patriots football player, 25, has pleaded not guilty to murder and firearms charges in the death of Lloyd, a semiprofessional football player who was dating his fiancée's sister. Scroll down for video . On trial: Aaron Hernandez is seen in court on Tuesday as his attorney shows a video of his home before closing arguments. His defense argued that he witnessed the killing of a friend but did not commit it himself . Defiant: Defense attorney James Sultan holds a photo of the murder scene during closing arguments . Prosecutor William McCauley points to Hernandez on Tuesday as he told jurors to simply look at the evidence . Prosecutors say the former tight end and two friends, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, picked up Lloyd at his Boston home before dawn on June 17, 2013, and drove him to an industrial park near Hernandez's house in North Attleboro, Massachusetts, where they shot him to death. Surveillance video at Hernandez's home minutes after the shooting showed him holding a black item that appeared to be a gun. A joint found near Lloyd's body had Hernandez's and Lloyd's DNA on it. Murdered: Semi-pro football player, Odin Lloyd, was shot dead near Hernandez's home in June 2013 . Cellphone records shared in court also showed the men communicating with Lloyd that night. Surveillance video along the way showed Hernandez driving the Nissan shortly before Lloyd's sister saw him get into a silver car, a moment captured on a neighbor's security camera. Soon after, a toll booth camera caught the Nissan leaving Boston, while Lloyd's phone pinged several cell towers before stopping in North Attleborough for good. His body was found in an industrial park less than a mile from Hernandez's home later that day. Lloyd had been shot six times. In his closing arguments, Assistant District Attorney William McCauley told jurors  to go through all the evidence. 'If you do that, you'll get to where you need to go, which is to find the defendant guilty for the murder of Odin Lloyd,' McCauley said. But the defense said the prosecution's case failed to prove Hernandez pulled the trigger. Prosecutors have never presented a motive to jurors and Sultan added on Monday that Hernandez and Lloyd were friends who shared 'a passion for marijuana'. 'Obviously they were friends,' Sultan told the jury. 'They were future brothers-in-law.' Wallace and Ortiz have also pleaded not guilty to murder charges and will be tried separately. Both men used the drug PCP, according to attorneys and court documents, and the defense team has sought to link use of the drug with violent, unpredictable behavior in an apparent attempt to shift blame for the murder on the pair. Blame game: Attorneys from the defense team said Carlos Ortiz, left, and Ernest Wallace, right, were responsible for the murder - not Hernandez. DNA and surveillance footage ties all three to the scene . Support: Shayanna Jenkins (left), Hernandez's girlfriend, and his mother Terri listen to the judge on Tuesday . Emotional: An uncle of Odin Lloyd is comforted as he hears details about his nephew's death on Tuesday . Investigators say Lloyd was shot multiple times with a Glock .45-caliber handgun that has not been found. Sultan said that after nine weeks of testimony, prosecutors 'still haven't proved to you who killed Odin Lloyd.' During the trial, which started in late January, the prosecution called 131 witnesses while the defense called three. Sultan also attacked the investigation, saying a shell casing removed from a rental car returned by Hernandez had been contaminated with his client's DNA from a piece of chewing gum stuck to it. 'The investigation done in this case was incomplete, biased and inept. That was not fair to Odin Lloyd, that was not fair to Aaron Hernandez, and it was not fair to you,' he said. 'All that effort and this is all they could come up with. What does that tell you?' Eighteen jurors began the trial in January, but three were dismissed, including one who is accused of misrepresenting her answers during screening in a bid to get onto the jury. Hernandez had a $41 million contract with the Patriots. He was cut after being charged with Lloyd's killing in June 2013. All smiles: The former New England Patriots football player smiles during a conversation with his defense lawyer Charles Rankin on Monday. His lawyers argued the prosecution has not proven he pulled the trigger .

Article: Two small boys, ages 5 and 3, drowned after the child-sized all-terrain vehicle (ATV) they were riding crashed into a pond in a rural area of Northern California. The California Highway Patrol says the boys died Sunday afternoon despite the father of one of the kids jumping into the water and pulling both children to shore. Investigators say the 5-year-old, identified as Blake Cronkhite, was driving the 50cc ATV, and his younger friend, Jayden Secrest, was on the back. Scroll down for video . Too young: Blake Cronkhite, 5 (left), and Jayden Secrest, 3 (right), drowned when their kid-size ATV plunged into large pond in Northern California . Crash: The boys were riding this kid-size 50cc ATV, with Blake at the wheel and Jayden on the back . Watery grave: the 5-year-old lost control of the vehicle and the ATV plunged into this large pond . CHP Officer David Martinez said Monday that the agency's investigation has focused on how the boys ended up in the pond and how well adults were supervising them while riding. The Sacramento Bee reports that the incident on private property near Auburn is listed as an accident and nobody has been cited or arrested. The accident took place in the driveway of the Cronkhite family's home in the 5100 block of Wise Road in rural Placer County as the children's fathers, William Secrest and Brandon Cronkhite, were doing yard work together. According to CHP, Blake and Jayden hopped on a small ATV, which had been brought to the house by a friend, and rode to a nearby pond, where the 5-year-old driver lost control and plunged into the water. Both boys were wearing helmets at the time. At one point, the parents noticed the absence of the boys and when looking for them. Then, a relative spotted a helmet bobbing in the water, prompting Brandon Cronkhite to race to the pond to try and save the children. After carrying Jayden and Blake to shore, Mr Cronkhite proceeded to perform CPR on them. Paramedics who arrived on the scene a short time later also made efforts to revive the unresponsive children. Rescue attempt: Blake's father, Brandon Cronkhite (left), jumped into the pond and brought the children ashore but could not revive them . Two helicopters transported the toddlers to UC Davis Medical Center, where they were pronounced dead in the span on an hour. In California, young children are permitted to ride ATVs on private property, so long as they have the proper supervision. Despite his tender age, Jayden Secrest was accustomed to being around vehicles. His father, William Secrest, is a member of Vagos Motorcycle club, and his Facebook albums are filled with photos of the toddler and his young cousins and friends zipping around on kid-sized dirt bikes and small ATVs. The CHP told the station KCRA they will investigate the incident, but it will be up to the district attorney to determine whether the parents will face charges. Mr Secrest expressed his anguish in a heartbreaking status update a day after the tragedy. Blake (left and right) and Jayden had helmets on at the time of the crash. The two young friends were airlifted to a hospital, where they died Sunday night . ‘I want to die and can't even describe the pain and emotions I'm feeling or the demons I'm fighting so I don't do anything stupid, but my life has crumbled so bad that I don't know what will happen,’ the grieving dad lamented. The two bereaved families have set up donation pages, one for Blake and one for Jayden, to help them with the final expenses. Heritage Church is also accepting donations on behalf of the Cronkhites and the Secrests.

Article: If they didn't know it already, Jose Mourinho has issued a gentle warning to Chelsea's next generation of exciting starlets that he cannot absorb them all into his first-team squad. 'I cannot have a squad of 10 men and 10 kids,' said Mourinho, as his club prepare for their fourth successive FA Youth Cup final, at Manchester City. Ask around about youth development and most experts feel Chelsea are getting it right at Academy level. Jose Mourinho has issued a gentle warning to Chelsea's next generation that he cannot use them all at once . Chelsea captain isiah Brown celebrates with the trophy after victory in the UEFA Youth League final . Ruben Loftus-Cheek has been part of the the first-team at Chelsea and is set to get his chance next season . The Under 19s won the UEFA Youth League last week and the Under 18s will attempt to defend the Youth Cup against Manchester City, another club working hard with some signs of success in this area. Neither of them, however, has quite solved the problem of bridging the final void, converting this prized talent into first-team footballers. John Terry was the last at Chelsea, but one or two of this crop are considered to have a genuine chance and Mourinho has promised 19-year-old Ruben Loftus-Cheek his opportunity next season. 'Next season, Ruben will not be a kid in the development process,' said Mourinho. 'He will be a first-team player, absolutely ready to play and compete. And we will do the same with two or three or four players. 'Some of the older ones will go on loan to play every game in the Championship or the Premier League, even abroad. And we will bring some of the younger ones into the process. But to have them all at the same time in the first-team squad is hard. 'I cannot have a squad of 10 men and 10 kids. I must have a squad like we have now of 16 or 17 seniors and three or four kids.' John Terry was the last truly successful youth product at Chelsea and he has gone on to become captain . Terry celebrates after Chelsea beat Manchester United on Saturday to tighten their grip on the title . Strikers Isiah Brown, 18, and Dominic Solanke, 17, are earmarked for big things, but Loftus-Cheek, at Chelsea since the age of eight, has precisely what Mourinho wants in his midfield. He is tall, strong, athletic, and has poise on the ball. He is not dissimilar to Nemanja Matic in style and might just save the club £70million they might otherwise be tempted to spend on someone like Paul Pogba from Juventus. This would be an enormous boost for Chelsea as they wriggle within the confines of UEFA's Financial Fair Play. Strikers Isiah Brown, 18, and Dominic Solanke, 17, are earmarked for big things after the European success . Loftus-Cheek, at Chelsea since the age of eight, has precisely what Mourinho wants in his first-team midfield . Mourinho would like extra muscle in central midfield for the big games. His experiments with Kurt Zouma alongside Matic have gone quite well, but ideally, he would prefer someone who can perform the same defensive duties and still flex into attack with pace and vision. Also, he will need Zouma at centre half. Pogba would strengthen Mourinho's team but what signal would that send to Loftus-Cheek, and the rest of those striving to graduate at Cobham and the give the club something it craves? The Chelsea manager said: 'From that team that won the UEFA Youth League, four belong to my squad. Four are my players, first-team players who train with the first-team every day and develop with the first-team. When they're not selected with the first-team - and normally they're not selected - they go back and play there. 'Their development is easier when they're training every day with the first-team, doing pre-season, playing some matches, playing 20 minutes or half an hour in an FA Cup match, Capital One Cup match, even a Champions League match or in the league now and again. The tall, powerful midfielder got his chance to play at Stamford Bridge against Sporting Lisbon in December . Paul Pogba is a player Chelsea are looking at but would cost £70million, a cost they could do with avoiding . 'They belong to a process. I can't have 10 of these young players in my squad but I can have three or four and we did that with Loftus-Cheek, Brown, (Andreas) Christensen and (Nathan) Ake - and Solanke a few times.' In tandem with this quest to nurture their own, Chelsea still cast around the globe and are scrambling to sign 19-year-old Brazilian striker Nathan from Atletico Paranaense and 22-year-old Yoshinori Muto from Tokyo. When these names were thrown his way, Mourinho shrugged and replied: 'I'm not working on that, not at all. I don't make offers, I coach players.' On Nathan, he added: 'He's a player that our structure followed, and our structure thinks it's a player with potential for the future. Chelsea are set to announce the £4.5million signing of Brazilian wonderkid Nathan as part of their recruitment . Tokyo forward Yoshinori Muto is another player Chelsea are interested in but Mourinho is not involved . 'If the deal is close, I will try to help him, as I try to help everyone, to become a Chelsea player. But he's not a player in my squad now, or a player I'm waiting for. I'm focused just on my job and my team. My team I love. My squad I love. The objective we are fighting for, I love it too.' His words reinforced the impression that one branch of Chelsea's development arm is busily signing, loaning and selling footballers with a view to economic gain; making money while hedging its bets in case one of these players turn out to be extra special. While another branch is focused more closely on producing players who might one day represent the club. Patrick Bamford is enjoying a very successful loan spells this season could force Mourinho into playing him . There is cross-over in the middle, of course, with those like Patrick Bamford and Bertrand Traore enjoying very successful loan spells this season and perhaps forcing Mourinho one day soon to consider if they are worth a chance in his squad. But as the manager has made clear, all these players are fighting for a maximum of 'three or four' places in the squad. It is a daunting task.

// Article: A terrified woman has revealed her estranged husband’s chilling plot to have her killed, not once, but twice. Angie Donohue has told how her husband of four years, Daryl Scott Donohue, 43, had tried to hire someone to kill her, even from the confines of his prison cell. ‘I was frightened of him, I was just terrified of him,’ Mrs Donohue revealed in an interview with A Current Affair. Scroll down for video . Angie Donohue broke down as she explained how her husband of four years had tried to hire someone to kill her, even from the confines of his prison cell. Daryl Scott Donohue tried to kill his wife, not once, but twice . Over the course of their marriage, Ms Donohue was forced into hiding after Donohue stalked and terrorised her before trying to hire ‘various people’ to kill her for money. Ms Donohue said that when they started the doomed romance, Donohue was a ‘nice, sweet and fun loving guy’ who  appeared ‘normal’. After dating for about a year the pair got engaged and started to plan a wedding. Ms Donohue said it was on the day that was meant to be the happiest of her life that she discovered her husband-to-be was not the man she thought he was. ‘He didn’t even make eye contact with me and I remember saying the night we were married “why didn’t you look at me?” He told her it was nerves but in that moment she knew something wasn’t quite right. ‘He didn’t even make eye contact with me and I remember saying the night we were married “why didn’t you look at me?” The couple both had children to previous relationships and Ms Donohue said she had no intentions of having any more children, but Donohue convinced her they should try for another baby. Once Ms Donohue fell pregnant, she said things started to get progressively worse. ‘Once I got pregnant it was like the real person emerged and it was kind of frighting.’ She said he became increasingly possessive, always checking her whereabouts and dictating exactly what she could and could not do. ‘Everything I did had to have approval… it was like a switch was flicked,’ she revealed in the emotional interview. Ms Donohue explained her husband became increasingly possessive, always checking her whereabouts and dictating exactly what she could and could not do . She said his controlling behaviour seeped into every aspect of her life; she couldn’t shop, eat or go out without his consent. He had taken control of all their finances. At this stage, Ms Donohue was faced with news that her unborn child was very unwell and he would require multiple surgeries to survive. Her son’s health became her main focus and as Ms Donohue started to approach the end of her pregnancy, the Tasmanian was told she needed to go to Melbourne so specialists could monitor the final stages of her complicated pregnancy.. After giving birth, Ms Donohue’s son was rushed to intensive care. She said she'd finally had enough and worked up the courage to leave her controlling husband. Ms Donohue was faced with tragic news that her  child was very unwell and he would require multiple surgeries to survive . After the birth of their son, Ms Donohue was about to leave her controlling husband when he pleaded that he would change . ‘I’d actually said to him “This isn’t how I’d imagined my life” but he eventually promised that he would change.’ Ms Donohue decided to give him another chance and stayed for several more years until Donohue stooped to a new low, striking his youngest and most vulnerable son. ‘I turned around and said “How dare you effing hit him? You know that he’s had a stroke, he’s had brain damage so why on earth would you smack him in the face?"' Donohue stooped to a new low, striking his youngest and most vulnerable son which prompted Ms Donohue to confront him about his behaviour . He told her he lashed out because their son ‘wouldn’t effing shut up’. Ms Donohue told her husband he had no right to touch their son like that and if he wanted to hit someone, he could hit her, to which he responded ‘I’m going to do one better’. Ms Donohue then took her children and left her abusive husband but he started to stalk the family. ‘He was everywhere,’ she said. Ms Donohue revealed he broke into the house, tampered with her Facebook account, accessed her emails and even attempted to hide out on her children's school grounds. She took this information to police but they told her there was little they could do for her. ‘He was taunting me,’ she added. Ms Donohue revealed her husband had broken into their house, he'd tampered with her Facebook account, accessed her emails and even attempted to hide on her kid's school grounds. She said she knew he was planning to kill her and he may well have succeeded if Donohue hadn’t made a crucial mistake that would alert police to his troubling behaviour. Donohue followed his estranged wife into an undercover car park where he smashed her rear breaklight, allegedly so he could easily follow her at night. The carpark was covered in CCTV cameras and he was caught in the act. Armed with the camera footage as evidence, police launched a major investigation into Daryl Scott Donohue. The blurry CCTV footage shows Donohue before he proceeded to smash his wife's break lights . They soon learned Ms Donohue's fear was justified as they learned he had tried to hire a hit man to murder his wife. ‘They told me a little bit. They told me enough to keep me aware that Daryl was trying to hire someone to kill me,’ she said. ‘The police turned around and said we need you to go away for a while, so we did.’ Ms Donohue and her children hid out in a hotel while an undercover officer posed as a hit man and went to meet Donohue. He offered the officer $10,000 in cash to carry out the hit. Police immediately arrested Donohue for trying to incite his wife’s murder. ‘I got the phone call saying its over, he’s been arrested.’ A photographer captured the moment Donohue was arrested for stalking and inciting his wife's murder . Police told her that her husband had approached ‘various people’ offering them money to ‘to get rid’ of her. Donohue plead guilty to both stalking and inciting murder and in Feburary, 2013, he was sentenced four years in jail. Ms Donohue was devastated he wasn’t put away for longer but she hoped while Donohue was behind bars, her family would be safe. ‘We thought, right, at least for four years, we can get on with our lives. We can just try and be normal.’ She said her son’s performance at school started to improve and slowly her life started to get better. ‘We thought, right, at least for four years, we can get on with our lives. We can just try and be normal’ Unbeknownst to Ms Donohue her husband was still plotting her murder, for the second time, from inside his jail cell. He approached inmates who he knew were about to go on parole and offered them cash to track down his wife and kill her. Scott, who was serving a three month sentence for burglary, was one of two inmates he offered $25,000 to murder Ms Donohue. He said Donohue would plan ways he could kill his wife, and her parents, so he could gain full custody of his children. Scott, who was serving a three month sentence for burglary, was one of two inmates he offered $25,000 to murder Ms Donohue . He allegedly suggested he should cut her break lines and then interfere with her pacemaker. He even offered up a plan to kill her parents by putting cyanide in their milk before texting Ms Donohue off their phone, to lure her to her own death. ‘He turned around and said if its not done in three weeks, I’ll have someone else to do it,’ Scott told A Current Affair. When Scott was released from prison, he immediately went to authorities and provided key information that lead to Donohue being charged for a second time. In Feburary this year, Donohue was found guilty by a court of law for inciting his wife’s murder, again. He was sentenced to a further seven years in jail. ‘You live in fear and you hate that somebody has that kind of control over you from inside prison’ Ms Donohue was taken aback that her husband could still try and hurt her from behind bars. ‘You live in fear and you hate that somebody has that kind of control over you from inside prison,’ she said. Donohue, who showed no remorse, underwent psychiatric testing where it was confirmed he had no mental illnesses that could have contributed to his twisted behaviour. While Ms Donohue would like to believe her ordeal is over, she said she still feels ‘unsafe’. ‘I have no doubt that he’s just not going to let go. He’s one very angry person and he wants me dead. I don’t feel safe.’ Ms Donohue has been offered to join witness protection but she said it isn’t an option. She believes her children need to be surrounded by the people who know and love them. ‘I thought I picked a sensible person. I thought I picked a safe person but it turned out I picked anything but and it turns out I put those kids in danger’ Ms Donohue said she still feels guilty for bringing this man into her children’s lives. ‘I thought I picked a sensible person. I thought I picked a safe person but it turned out I picked anything but and it turns out I put those kids in danger.’ Ms Donohue said she wants as many people as possible to hear her story, and see the face of her killer husband, in case he ever makes another attempt on her life. Donohue is reportedly trying to appeal his second, seven-year, conviction however a hearing date is yet to be determined.

// Article: Murderer: Ronald Jebson, who was responsible for the 'Babes in the Woods' killings, when first jailed in the 1970s, died of kidney failure almost a fortnight ago . A paedophile serial killer who murdered three children and sexually abused several more has died secretly in prison, it was revealed today. Ronald Jebson, who was responsible for the 'Babes in the Woods' murders in 1970, died of kidney failure almost a fortnight ago. Jebson's final wish was for his death to be secret and victims' families only found out after journalists told them 11 days after he died. Beryl Hanlon, whose 12-year-old son Gary was killed together with his 11-year-old friend Susan Blatchford in 1970, sobbed as she heard the news. Mrs Hanlon said: 'I'm glad to hear he's gone. I just don't want him to be able to hurt anyone else's children. 'I still have nightmares. I just can't sleep at night. I wake up crying sometimes I just can't understand how some people are so evil. 'I keep imagining what Jebson did to him'. Four years after killing the two friends Jebson strangled eight-year-old Rosemary Papper, shose sister Samantha Humbles, 45, said: 'He deserves to rot in hell' Jebson, who was being held at HMP Frankland, which also holds child killer Ian Huntley, died at the University Hospital of North Durham 11 days ago. A prison source told The Sun: 'He was bitter and twisted and did not want people to have the satisfaction and relief of knowing he was dead.' In 2000 he confessed his part in the deaths of Gary Hanlon, 12, and Susan Blatchford, 11, thirty years earlier, while serving a life sentence for strangling an eight-year-old girl. The murder of the pair in 1970 became known as the Babes in the Wood case because their bodies were dumped in a copse on the fringes of Epping Forest in Essex. Bereft: Beryl Hanlon, whose 12-year-old son Gary was murdered by Jebson said: 'I'm glad to hear he's gone. I just don't want him to be able to hurt anyone else's children' Crimes: In 2000 confessed his part in the deaths of friends Gary Hanlon, 12, and Susan Blatchford, 11, who he murdered and dumped on the edge of Epping Forest . Jebson finally confessed to police because he felt he could die shortly 'and did not want to go into his grave knowing the murder of the two young friends was still unsolved. He wanted to clear his conscience,' said Richard Whittham, prosecuting. But he refused to accompany police to the area where he had sexually abused and killed his victims because he feared the ghosts of the children would haunt the area. Serial killer: Jebson, pictured, had also strangled eight year old Rosemary Papper . Jebson admitted he had been evil over the years and was a danger to children. 'If I get a few drinks and poppers, nothing would stop me,' he had said. The Ministry of Justice is said to have made attempts to contact the families of the children murdered by Mr Jebson to inform them of his death. The government department said it does not discuss individual cases but a spokesman added: 'It is ridiculous to suggest prison staff would deliberately prevent deaths in custody being made public. 'Offenders do not decide whether victims' families are informed about their death.' Gary and Susan vanished from their homes in Enfield, North London, after Gary called for her and they left to go for a walk. They were last seen together strolling and laughing as they went across fields. Jebson, who had previous convictions for sexually assaulting children, told police he picked them up on March 1 and drove them to a spot where he shared cannabis with them. He then took them into a copse and sexually assaulted them. After killing them, he left them about a foot apart in a bird watcher's hide in the copse. Their bodies were found on June 17, 1970, covered in twigs. A cause of death could not be ascertained at the time and no-one was charged. Jebson kept his evil secret for decades. In 1974, he was sentenced to life at St Albans Crown Court for another paedophile murder of the eight-year-old daughter of a friend. Jebson had picked up Rosemary Papper from school, bought her sweets and raped her before strangling her with a piece of twine in a field in Hertfordshire. The judge recommended he should serve at least 20 years. Crime scene: The bodies of the two children were found here in this copse on the edge of Epping Forest but the crime remained unsolved for 30 years . It was not until 1996 that Jebson gave the first indication to a prison officer that he was responsible for the Babes in the Wood murders. It started a chain of events including the exhumation of Susan's grave in Ponders End, North London, which ended decades of uncertainty for the children's families. Jebson originally implicated two other people in their deaths. But, over four years, police broke down his story and he admitted sole responsibility. The nightmare began with two schoolfriends disappearing after going for a walk on a grey and blustery afternoon in 1970. Eleven weeks later the discovery of their bodies huddled together under a pile of leaves and twigs left the nation in shock. In 2000 three decades of anguish for the mothers of Susan Blatchford, 11, and Gary Hanlon, 12, came to an emotional close as paedophile Ronald Jebson, who was already in jail for another murder, finally admitted raping and strangling them. Hunt: The murders of Susan and Gary became one of Britain's most high profile unsolved murders until Jebson finally admitted he did it . Beryl Hanlon and Muriel Blatchford, who are both widowed, broke down in tears as 61-year-old Jebson was led away from the dock at the Old Bailey in the final act of what became-known as the Babes in the Wood mystery. The children fell victim to the perverted Jebson on that spring day 30 years ago after Susan knocked at Gary Hanlon's door at around 4pm on March 31 to ask if he wanted to go for a walk. Gary got his mum's permission to go out and, with his football under his arm, set off with Susan. They were seen an hour later walking across a field laughing together. It was the last time they were seen alive. In 2000 three decades of anguish for the mothers of Susan Blatchford, 11, pictured, and Gary Hanlon, 12, came to an emotional close as paedophile . Their parents reported them missing and a massive hunt was launched. Day after day, more than 600 police officers were joined by members of the public. Frogmen and teams of sniffer dogs were brought in but the friends appeared to have vanished. Nearly three months later, on June 17, a man walking his dog discovered the children's bodies in a copse in Epping Forest, Essex, 30 minutes walk from their home. As a stunned Britain struggled to absorb the news, post mortem tests failed to discover how they died. Time and again the question was posed of how two healthy, sensible young children could meet their deaths in such inexplicable circumstances. Their parents were convinced they had been murdered. Police agreed and launched an investigation under the leadership of Detective Chief Superintendent Leonard 'Nipper' Read, the man who nailed the Krays. During the inquiry 14,272 people were interviewed, but no one was brought to justice. It was the only murder 'Nipper' Read failed to solve during his long career. It left the Babes in the Wood one of the most intriguing and tragic unsolved mysteries in a generation. Jebson's confession finally vindicated the families' belief that Susan and Gary were murdered. He lived in lodgings in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, at the time, said he randomly selected his victims as he drove home after visiting an employment office in Enfield. High on drink and drugs, he took them to a field where he raped Susan. When Gary told him he wanted to go home, he told him: 'You're not going anywhere.' He then beat and raped him, before strangling both children and keeping Susan's tights, bra and knickers as 'trophies'. Today, describing that day, Beryl Hanlon said: 'You could always hear his football when he was kicking it around. 'I realise I couldn't hear him playing football and I looked out of the widow and he was gone.' She added: 'In the 1970s no-one knew about paedophiles. We were just told about dirty old men. 'All the children used to play together on the estate. We all thought of it as such a safe place.'

Article: Breathtaking scenery, beautiful castles and that signature Scottish hospitality. These are just some of the reasons that Scotland has recently been named the most popular wedding destination in the UK, according to a survey by the country's tourist board. And as local tennis hero, Andy Murray, prepares to marry his sweetheart Kim Sears in Dunblane on Saturday, interest in the country is at an all time high. The tennis star will wed Kim Sears in his hometown of Dunblane, north of Stirling, on April 11 . VisitScotland promotes country as the ideal wedding destination, in light of Andy Murray's upcoming nuptuals . In fact, last year, a quarter (24 per cent) of all marriages in Scotland involved couples from outside of the country. And the allure of the picturesque countryside and unusual Scottish wedding traditions has also had a serious economic impact on the region, with the wedding tourism industry bringing in £80 million last year alone. A recent survey has found that Scotland held 5.54 marriages per 1,000 - making it the most popular part of the UK in which to tie the knot. Southwest England was a close second however, boasting 5.40 per 1,000. The pair will tie the knot at the Dunblane Cathedral, a beautiful medieval church in central Scotland . However, the most popular wedding destination in the country is the council area of Dumfries and Galloway . Gretna Green, Dumfries and Galloway . The council area of Dumfries and Galloway, in the southwest of the country, was the most popular, thanks in large part to Gretna Green. The village, historically one of the first in Scotland, is famous for its runaway weddings, which began in 1754 during the time of Lord Hardwicke's Marriage Act. Such popularity can be attributed in large part to Gretna Green, a town famous for its 'runaway weddings' Today, it remains one of the world's most popular wedding destinations, playing host to 5,000 weddings each year. And it's popular among Scots as well, with one in six opting to get hitched in the romantic locale. Argyll and Bute is the second most popular area for weddings in Scotland and is home to Barcaldine Castle . Argyll and Bute . Another popular wedding destination, Argyll and Bute is home to 11.21 marriages per 1,000 in Scotland. Not only is the area known for its stunning scenery, but it's also conveniently located less than two hours north of Glasgow. With plenty of stunning castles littering the countryside, couples are undoubtedly spoiled for choice when it comes to picking a venue, with Barcaldine Castle a popular option. On the coast of the Firth of Clyde, the Culzean Castle in South Ayrshire is a beloved wedding site . South Ayrshire . Slightly further north than Dumfries and Galloway, on the coast of the Firth of Clyde, is the beautiful South Ayrshire council. Rich in historical significance, the area is also known to be the birthplace of Robert Burns - and couples even have the option to get married at the Scot's birthplace museum. Other popular venues include the opulent Culzean Castle, the gorgeous crumbling ruins of the Dundonald Castle, and the sprawling grounds of the Enterkine House Hotel. A-listers have long favoured Scotland for the big day, with Jennifer Connelly marrying in East Lothian in 2003 . 1. Dumfries and Galloway . 2. Argyll and Bute . 3. South Ayrshire . 4. Perth and Kinross . 5. Highland . 6. Stirling . 7. Edinburgh . 8. East Lothian . 9. North Ayrshire . 10. Scottish Borders . According to a VisitScotland report, those who choose Scotland for their wedding usually fall into one of four groups: those with Scottish roots; those who want to get away from it all; those with a university or childhood connection to the area; and those inspired by the romance and celebrity appeal of Scotland, such as Andy Murray selecting the country for his high-profile affair. And the tennis star is keeping good celebrity company. Other A-listers who have opted to marry in Scotland include Madonna and Guy Ritchie, who wed at the Skibo Castle in 2000. Actress Jennifer Connelly married Paul Bettany at Gilmerton House in East Lothian, Scotland, in 2003. And daughter of Paul McCartney and fashion designer to the stars, Stella McCartney, opted to tie the knot at Mount Stuart in the summer of the same year. Fashion designer Stella McCartney wed at Mount Stuart on the Isle of Bute in Scotland in summer 2003 . Tourist weddings in Scotland tend to be a bit more expensive than those in other parts of the UK, although the average number of guests is generally smaller. Couples tend to stay in Scotland for six nights around their wedding date and make several weekend trips in advance of the big day to make arrangements. 'Put simply, Scotland is one of the most beautiful places in the world in which to get married,' explained Mike Cantlay, Chairman of VisitScotland. 'From the splendour and magnificence of our castles and historic homes, to the wild romantic nature of our lochs, mountains, islands and coastlines, there is a uniqueness and magic to having  your big day on Scottish soil.'

Article: For talented youth team strikers fighting for their big break in the game, goals really are the best currency to convert into those precious first-team minutes. And after extraordinary seasons in which they have both smashed the 35-goal mark, Chelsea's teenage strike duo Tammy Abraham and Dominic Solanke are certainly flush at the moment. The two 17-year-olds are in the form of their young lives, enhancing their reputations every time they find the net and boosting their chances of Jose Mourinho handing them some game time once the Premier League title has been secured. Tammy Abraham scores for Chelsea during their 3-1 FA Youth Cup final first leg win against Manchester City . Striker Dominic Solanke celebrates after scoring Chelsea's third goal at the Academy Stadium on Monday . And after the Portuguese manager said his first-team squad had space for 'three or four kids' next season, there is every incentive to keep scoring. The latest victim of their remarkable goalscoring spree was Manchester City in the first leg of the FA Youth Cup final on Monday night. Chelsea will take a commanding 3-1 lead into the second leg at Stamford Bridge after Abraham's double - which took his tally to 36 for the season - was added to late on by Solanke, who has now reached 35. The Blues have consciously tried to recruit talented young players from the London area and Camberwell-born Abraham, who joined the club in the under eights, is a success story of this policy. By any standards, he has enjoyed an exceptional season and one that has featured numerous milestones in his development. Most striking has been the sheer volume of goals for the under 18 team, who finished 10 points clear at the top of the southern section of the Premier League at that age group, and are currently competing in the play-off round. Abraham is top scorer in the whole competition with 22 goals. Solanke (No 9) celebrates with Abraham after the latter's second goal of the night and 36th this season . Solanke, pictured scoring against City, could play for the first-team against Arsenal this weekend . Highlights included back-to-back hat-tricks in away matches with Tottenham (which ended in 4-2 and 6-4 wins), plus four goals during Chelsea's run to success in the UEFA Youth League, the continental competition for under 19 teams. This campaign has also seen a scoring debut for Chelsea's under 21 side and a first involvement with the England youth set-up. It has been the kind of scoring sequence where pretty much anything struck seems to fly into the top corner and that was the case for Abraham's first goal against City. Controlling Charlie Colkett's excellent ball over the top to allow it to run across his body, he sent his shot spearing into the top corner. It was a moment that drew considerable attention on Twitter. Little wonder the dreadlocked frontman described 'scoring goals as the best feeling ever' in an interview after the match. His second goal showed the sort of instinct all successful strikers need, positioning himself on the edge of City's six-yard box to hook the ball home after the goalkeeper had blocked an initial header from Izzy Brown. Abraham (right) poses with team-mates Charly Musonda and Izzy Brown (L-R) after winning the Youth League . Solanke trains regularly with Chelsea's first-team and made his senior debut against Maribor this season . Another strength is his ability to play across the forward line, on either flank or as a central targetman. On Monday, he started on the right, with Solanke as the No 9 and Izzy Brown on the other side. When asked about it, Abraham showed a studious nature when it comes to watching the game: 'Over the years you see how people have to change their positions in games and it's a good thing if you can adapt.' Solanke is a more familiar name to not only followers of Chelsea but football fans in general. He has been part of Mourinho's first-team squad all season alongside Brown, 18, and the midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek, 19. They train daily with the first team and Solanke made his professional debut when he replaced Oscar for the final 20 minutes of a Champions League match with Maribor back in October. He seems well-suited to the continental stage, as shown by the tournament-best 12 goals he scored as Chelsea became the first English side to lift the Youth League after beating Shakhtar Donetsk in Nyon, Switzerland last week. Solanke scored in every round in that competition and has now done likewise in the Youth Cup, a competition he won when Chelsea beat Fulham in last season's final. Abraham acrobatically puts Chelsea 2-1 ahead against Manchester City after Isaac Buckley's equaliser . Solanke scores Chelsea's second goal in their 3-2 win over Shakhtar Donetsk in the UEFA Youth League final . By his standards, it was a quiet night against City but when his chance came in the closing minutes, he made no mistake and scored a potentially tie-killing third. With Diego Costa out injured and Loic Remy and Didier Drogba doubtful, there is a chance Solanke will play against Arsenal in the Premier League this weekend. His performances this season, which has also seen him elevated to England Under 18 standard, mean he is no longer an unknown quantity but any first-team action between now and the close of the campaign will be valuable. Solanke is calm about his future but certainly not complacent. He said after the Youth League success: 'It's a tough task at Chelsea to get into the first team but you've just got to keep working and see what happens. 'You've got to keep trying to improve and impress and who knows what happens in the future.' Like Abraham, he is certainly making a compelling case at the moment.

Article: Loss: Audrie Pott, 15, killed herself in 2012 after she was sexually assaulted at a party. Two of her attackers have finally apologized and admitted she was unconscious during the 'criminal act' Two teenagers have finally apologized for sexually assaulting a 15-year-old girl who later committed suicide after images of the attack were shared around her high school. The pair, who have not been named, admitted Audrie Pott was unconscious at the time and did not consent to their 'criminal acts' as they reached a civil settlement with her family. They also apologized for sharing false rumors spread around Saratoga High School in Northern California that 'served to shame and humiliate her'. The teenager fell asleep after drinking Gatorade laced with vodka at a friend's party in their hometown of Saratoga. She awoke to find her pants off and lewd comments scribbled over her body. Her family says she hanged herself days later after learning cellphone photos were taken of her during the assault and shared through text messages. Audrie's parents, Lawrence and Sheila Pott, filed a civil lawsuit against the boys to hold them more accountable for their actions. Their attorney, Bob Allard, said the parents decided to settle with one of the teens because he showed remorse and 'told the truth' about what happened to Audrie. Now the final two teens have reached an agreement after initially refusing to say sorry - reportedly paying $950,000 to the devastated family. As part of the settlement, they were also made to release a lengthy apology and will have to give presentations about 'sexting', sharing nude photos, 'slut-shaming' and the dangers of alcohol. The pair said:  'We apologize that we said things that made it seem like Audrie invited or encouraged these acts. 'We admit that we committed these acts and shared inappropriate images of Audrie to others. 'Audrie wasn't conscious during these criminal acts that we committed and did not consent to what we did.' They also apologized for false rumors that 'served to shame and humiliate her'. It continued: 'We would like every teenager out there to understand that words about someone's character can have a life altering effect. That taking advantage of an incapacitated human being is a crime each and every time. They also said they would participate and support a petition to to the Saratoga High School Administration to give Audrie an honorary diploma, because their 'actions contributed to prevent her from graduating. During a hearing on Friday, the boys stood up and apologized to the courtroom, including Audrie's parents, to mark the signing of the agreement. According to the San Jose Mercury, one of them said: 'I wish Audrie was still here, and I miss her a lot. She was a great person who didn't deserve anything that happened to her due to my actions. I apologize. I wish I could make it right.' Anger: Larry Pott and and Audrie's stepmother and his second wife Lisa, have finally settled their lawsuit against two of their daughter's attackers after one admitted and apologized . Grieving: Audrie's mother, Sheila Pott, found her daughter hanging in the bathroom in September 2012 . Tormentors: The three teenagers (pictured with their faces obscured) pleaded guilty to sexual assault last year and were sentenced to 30-45 days in a juvenile detention facility . The second teen, who is now a senior at Christopher High in Gilroy, said that if he could, he would 'take back the pain and suffering I caused Audrie and the Pott family. This has caused a tragedy to all involved due to my actions.' He added: 'I will do everything I can to mentor teens to not do what I did in September 2012.' The teenagers also agreed to be interviewed in a documentary film already in production about the case. The three attackers, all classmates, were prosecuted in private juvenile proceedings and sentenced to between 30 and 45 days in juvenile hall. Two continue to attend Saratoga High, while the third transferred to high school about an hour south in Gilroy. Allard said that had the two other teens apologized, they might not have been sued. 'If they had simply knocked on the door of the Pott household, apologized, accepted responsibility and jumped headfirst into our quest to educate our youth by, for example, speaking at high schools about the mistakes they made and how this can be prevented, there would be no civil lawsuit,' Allard said. Audrie's parents led the campaign to pass a California law which allows prosecutors to seek harsher sentences for juvenile sex offenders who take pictures of their crimes and use them to bully the victims. The trio of teenagers whom Daily Mail Online is not identifying because they are minors, pleaded guilty in January 2014 and were sentenced to 30 to 45 days each in a juvenile detention facility. Pott, from Saratoga, California, hung herself September 10, 2012 - just eight days after the teens digitally penetrated her at an alcohol-fueled Labor Day party and took pictures of her in a compromised state. The 15-year-old girl felt humiliated after she discovered that the cellphone photos showing her naked body covered in lewd comments written in marker had been shared with students at her school. In February, Pott's parents tried to get all three expelled from their schools - which they returned to after their sentences. Cruel: Pott, right, was assaulted after a night of drinking and boys spread photos of the attack . They launched a petition on the site Change.org calling on the principals of Saratoga High School and Christopher High School to expel the three perpetrators responsible for Audrie's 'slut-shaming.' At a party in early September 2012, Audrie Pott drank alcohol-laced Gatorade and woke up without her shorts on, with her face painted black and with mocking comments written in indelible marker all over her body. Over the course of the next week, Audrie learned that cellphone photos had been taken of her during the assault, which involved digital penetration, and shared with students at the school she attended with the three attackers. 'My life is over...I ruined my life and I don't even remember how,' Audrie said to a classmate in the days following the incident. She then pleaded with the boys to delete the photos. 'I swear to god if u still have those pictures illl killl u [sic],' she wrote to one of her alleged attackers in the days after the party. 'It's gonna get out.' Another male classmate responded: 'lol that s*** gets around haha everyone knows mostly everything hahaah.' Left behind: Audrie is pictured left with her father, step mother and half brother and sisters . Eight days after the attack, on September 12, 2012, Audrie hanged herself in a bathroom at her mother's house. In police interviews, the teenagers admitted to coloring half of her face black with marker, then pulling down her bra, taking off her shorts and drawing on her breasts and near her genitals. They photographed themselves sexually assaulting her and, by the time she started her sophomore year at Saratoga High School two days later, scores of students had seen the images. Rolling Stone magazine has revealed the torment Audrie suffered in the days before her death and has detailed the messages she exchanged with her alleged attackers, whom she had known since middle school. She messaged one boy, vowing to kill him if he still had the images. 'They are deleted and I didn't take them,' he wrote. 'I promise it wasn't me.' 'I'm sorry about the marker,' he added of the drawings that covered her body. She also messaged another boy who had been at the party to ask if one of the teenagers had photographs of her. 'ur fine,' he responded. 'ill make sure nothing goes around.' She replied: 'It's gonna get out. S*** always does. Especially with the people who were there.'

Article: Reports of Cristiano Ronaldo's decline have been greatly exaggerated: The Real Madrid forward scored five goals against Granada, taking his tally in La Liga to 36 for the season - more than half of Europe's top teams. Granada were torn to shreds by Ronaldo and his Real team-mates as the European champions won 9-1 at the Bernabeu, and their Portuguese talisman managed the first five-goal haul of his career. His record of 36 league goals for the season overtook Lionel Messi's 32 strikes, and put him in the incredible position of having scored more goals than 53 of the 98 teams in Europe's top five leagues this season. Cristiano Ronaldo scored an incredible five goals against Granada to lift his tally for the season to 36 . Granada were torn to shreds by Ronaldo and his Real team-mates as the European champions won 9-1 . The Portuguese star now has more goals than 53 teams in Europe's top leagues, including nine in England . There are nine teams in the Barclays Premier League who have managed fewer goals in the league than Cristiano Ronaldo has this season. They are: . Stoke City, Newcastle United, West Bromwich Albion, Hull City, Aston Villa, Sunderland, Queens Park Rangers, Burnley and Leicester City. Ronaldo took some flak last month after a series of poor performances for Real, but his goalscoring has never waivered and even through a difficult period he managed six goals in 10 games, the sort of record most strikers can only dream of. And his displays across the season have brought more goals than the likes of Newcastle United, Malaga, Borussia Dortmund, Torino and Lille. The first three of his five goals against Granada marked the quickest hat-trick of his career, coming in just eight first half minutes. Another followed 16 minutes later, and his last came 35 minutes after that. Ronaldo's displays across the season have brought more goals than the likes of Borussia Dortmund and Lille . It all adds up to a brilliant Easter Sunday for the world's best player, and he spoke of his delight afterwards . Lionel Messi and Barcelona came out on top in El Clasico but he has fewer league goals than Ronaldo . Borussia Dortmund, who can boast Marco Reus among their ranks, have fewer goals than the Real talisman . While Ronaldo overtook Messi on the goalscoring charts, the hat-trick - which could have been doubled - levelled the Argentine's record of 24 La Liga trebles. He almost matched Real legend Alfredo Di Stefano's 28 hat-tricks for Los Blancos in what was their biggest league win in 48-and-a-half years. It all adds up to a brilliant Easter Sunday for the world's best player, and he posted on Twitter after the game, saying: 'Happy to have scored 5 goals with this excellent team work. Thank you for all your support.' If the critics still see Ronaldo as greedy, it certainly paid off at the Santiago Bernabeu on Sunday.

Article: A 31-year-old British woman has died in a freak accident when she was crushed by a falling tree in the Bolivian jungle while on her dream round-the-world trip. Louise Shepherd had been hiking through the remote Madidi national park in the north-western part of the country when a tree toppled onto her during a storm. Ms Shepherd, from Cobham, Surrey, had taken a 'gap year' off work in order to go travelling around the world with her sister Hannah and college friend Rose Jones, both 30. Tragedy: Louise Shepherd, 31, from Cobham, Surrey, was hiking through a national park in north-west Bolivia with her sister and a friend when a tree toppled onto her during a storm . Her grief-stricken parents, Peter and Christine Shepherd from Cobham, Surrey said they were left having to choose a burial plot instead of planning for her birthday. Mrs Shepherd said: 'She lit up a room, everybody instantly liked her. 'We have been so moved by all the condolence cards from around the world.

Article: Dog walkers have been warned about deliberate attempts to kill their animals after cocktail sausages laced with poison were found at a popular walking spot. A clutch of sausages stuffed with poisons were found on the Cuckoo Trail, a path running from Hampden Park to Heathfield near Hailsham. The grim discovery comes after a spate of dog poisonings in nearby Brighton and Hove, and dog owners are now being warned by Sussex Police to be aware when they are out walking their animals. A man out walking his dog found a clutch of cocktail sausages with poisonous pellets inserted into them . The cocktail sausages were so densely packed with the poison that eating just one could have killed a dog. They were found hidden among grass on the trail. Photos of the Cuckoo Trail sausages were posted on the Doggy Style pet service page. The post said 'Walking along the Cuckoo trail in Hailsham at approximately 6pm this evening, I have found a quantity of cocktail sausages that appear to have a as of yet an unknown substance deliberately inserted into them. 'So this post is hopefully to help make other owners aware of the possible dangers. The sausages were loaded with the poison (left) and found hidden among the grass (right) on the trail . 'Thankfully I have a search dog that is able to indicate if something doesn't smell right, but please watch any dog off the lead as they were not in eye sight but easily consumed and in multiple places along the trail. 'Hopefully this is the action of some bored mis-guided youth, (which I'm sure this isn't the case!) but personally I find this premeditated, calculated with actions of someone who knows what they are doing.' Dogs that have been poisoned may show the following symptoms; . * Vomiting . * Diarrhoea . * Seizures . * Blood in the stool . * Lethargy . * Loss of appetite . * Bruising . * Nosebleeds . * Discoloured gums . If dogs display any of these symptoms they should be taken to a vet straight away. If possible take the packaging or sample of the poison with you. Do not attempt to medicate dogs yourself, or encourage them to vomit using salt water. If the skin or fur is damaged wash them with a mild shampoo and rinse well with water. Keep poisoned dogs away from other animals to avoid cross contamination.

Article: Jose Mourinho has launched a fresh verbal attack on Arsenal, branding their 11 year wait for the Premier League title as 'boring'. Led by skipper John Terry - whose performance was described as his best ever by Mourinho - the Blues produced a defensive master class in a goalless draw at the Emirates Stadium to take a step closer to the championship. Frustrated at what they perceived as the visitors' lack of attacking intent, home supporters chanted: 'Boring, boring Chelsea' throughout Sunday's clash. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has hit out at Arsenal and branded their 11-year wait for the title 'boring' Didier Drogba posted this picture on Instagram  of Branislav Ivanovic, Nemanja Matic, Cesar Azpilicueta, Eden Hazard, John Terry and Cesc Fabregas after the PFA awards .

Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger accused Chelsea of being purposefully defensive during the goalless draw . Leicester (away) - April 29 . Crystal Palace (home) - May 3 . Liverpool (home) - May 10 . West Brom (away) - May 18 . Sunderland (home) - May 24 . Their views were shared by Arsene Wenger, who said Chelsea 'came to defend' after the final whistle. But Mourinho, who started the game without a recognised centre-forward, hit back, insisting Arsenal's 11 years without winning the league is truly mundane. 'Boring, I think, is 10 years without a title. That's very boring,' said the Portuguese. 'You support the club and you're waiting, waiting, waiting for so many years without a Premier League title, so that's very boring. 'But maybe they weren't singing to us. Maybe, when you want to win a game and you're at home and you take your No 9 [Olivier Giroud] off, maybe the home fans want to see Danny Welbeck and Giroud up front. Chelsea are 10 points clear of second placed Manchester City at the top of the table with five games to play . 'The boring team is the second team with most goals in the Premier League, the best goal difference. Only Manchester City have scored more goals than us. 'If you tell the truth, people will fall in love with it. But you have to tell the truth. If you say the truth, you will walk in the truth and people will blow kisses at you.' 'So I think we scored a lot of goals and, in a period where we don't have Diego Costa or Loic Remy and have only one striker, we need to work in a way where he can help ourselves with all the matches we are having. 'We changed a bit our dynamic and we are not scoring so many goals as before. Mourinho, whose side need five points to secure the title, hasn't needed much encouragement in criticising the Gunners since arriving in England in 2004. He labelled Arsene Wenger a 'voyeur' in 2005, before branding the Frenchman a 'specialist in failure' last season. The Special One was much more positive on the performance of his captain at the Emirates Stadium. 'I told John Terry in the dressing room that he made some fantastic performances with me but this was his best,' said Mourinho.

Mourinho believes that Terry's performance against Arsenal was the best of the defender's career . 'It was the best JT has ever played. It was absolutely amazing. One performance at Highbury, I think in my first season, that was a fantastic performance, too. 'But I think today everything was clean: reading the game, giving cover, the defensive line, interceptions, reading the game so well, interceptions with a pass. 'The team was phenomenal, but John was one step ahead of every other player.' Midfielder Oscar, who was taken to hospital with suspected concussion after a heavy collision with David Ospina, started the game at centre-forward. In explaining his decision not to start with a recognised striker, Mourinho, who confirmed Costa and Remy are likely to miss the clash at Leicester, added: 'First of all, Drogba didn't work with us until Saturday so we'd developed the game-plan tactically, on the pitch, for the whole week without [Didier] Drogba. 'We knew that with Oscar we would get behind them like we did so many times in the first half. 'In the second half we played with a target man [Drogba], more on the counter-attack, but every time we recovered the ball on the counter, they made a tactical foul.'

Article: Ed Balls has been accused of treating the public with 'contempt' after dismissing as a 'joke' the infamous Labour note admitting the party had blown the nation's finances. The shadow chancellor said the letter, left in the Treasury by the former Labour minister Liam Byrne in 2010, was just a 'jokey note'. Mr Byrne's glib note to his successor as Treasury Secretary stated: 'Dear Chief Secretary, I'm afraid there is no money. Kind regards – and good luck! Liam.' Scroll down for video . Damaging: Labour's Liam Byrne sent left this handwritten note to his successor before he left the Treasury in 2010 . The note has become emblematic of Labour's fiscal irresponsibility in office and was used by David Cameron in the seven-way leaders' debate earlier this month. When the Coalition took office in 2010 the budget deficit had reached more than £150billion – more than 10 per cent of the entire size of the economy. But Mr Ball insisted the note admitting that Labour had blown the nation's finances should not be taken seriously. He told BBC West Midlands: 'Liam Byrne's note was a jokey note… of the course the money hadn't run out.' Mr Balls said Labour would cut the deficit – still running at £90billion a year – every year. He said: 'Nothing in our manifesto is going to require additional borrowing. I think in tough times, people want a government which will make tough decisions, and will make the sums add up, and that is what we're saying very clearly today.' But he was asked if Labour was 'credible' and could be trusted with the economy. Mr Balls said: 'I think people want to know the sums add up. People know that the global financial crisis wasn't caused by Labour's spending – it wasn't Labour's spending on nurses and doctors which meant the Lehman Brothers investment bank went bankrupt in New York. 'Liam Byrne's note was a jokey note, of course the money hadn't run out.' Ed Balls, pictured in Birmingham today, said the letter, left in the Treasury by the former Labour minister Liam Byrne in 2010, was just a 'jokey note' Mr Balls blamed the Lib Dem minister David Laws for leaking the note. He said it was supposed to be a private note, adding: 'It was supposed to be a piece of humour. In fact, in that year, the government spend hundreds of billions of pounds, so of course the money hadn't run out, but there was a large deficit, and we had to get it down, and we needed to get it down in a fair way. 'The reason why we're more credible than the Tories now is that they're not people who understand the need for change in the economy, it's not been all in it together, they've not even balanced the books – it's going to take a Labour government to do it.' Former Treasury Secretary Liam Byrne left the note to his successor David Laws in 2010 . The Tories this morning slammed Mr Balls's remarks – claiming they showed that he had not learnt the lessons from the great economic crash. Treasury minister David Gauke said: 'The fact that Ed Balls thinks the debt they left the country was a 'joke' goes to show the contempt they hold the public in. 'It is clear Labour has not learnt the lessons of the past and would do the same all over again - more taxes, more borrowing and more debt.' The letter has haunted Labour for years, allowing Tory and Liberal Democrat ministers to prove the nation's coffers were empty. The letter consisting of just 18 words it offers no apology or justification for the state of the nation's finances, only a glib 'good luck' to whoever was left to clear up the economic mess. Written in blue ink on government note paper, it was opened by Lib Dem David Laws who became Chief Secretary to the Treasury when the coalition was formed. Lib Dem Mr Laws said: 'He left a note which frankly does sum up precisely the state of the Treasury when he left it. I think it is refreshing that a Labour politician has been prepared to admit that.' Mr Byrne has admitted he will regret it for the rest of his life. He said: 'It was a very foolish thing to do. 'I suppose I did think there was a convention amongst honourable members that private correspondence would stay private. 'There's obviously a very old tradition of these notes that goes back to the 1930s. I felt disappointed that some very old conventions had been cast aside for political advantage.'

Article: Sam Allardyce believes Queens Park Rangers goalkeeper Rob Green is good enough to challenge England No 1 Joe Hart for a place in the national team. Green, capped 12 times, endured a famously turbulent time as England goalkeeper, with his calamitous error in England’s 1-1 draw with USA at the 2010 World Cup a particular lowlight. But after a fine 2011-12 season with Allardyce’s West Ham in the Championship, he gained his first international cap since World Cup humiliation. And Allardyce, whose side face Green and Co at Loftus road on Saturday, still holds his former stopper in high esteem and thinks the 35-year-old could once again stake a claim to be England’s main man between the posts. Rob Green trains ahead of QPR's Premier League match against his former club West Ham on Saturday . Green has won 12 England caps but made a calamitous error in the World Cup against USA in 2010 . The QPR goalkeeper allowed a speculative effort to go through his hands and was unable to retrieve it . The ball trickled over the line as Clint Dempsey's strike earned USA a 1-1 in the opening group match . ‘He could rival Joe Hart,’ Allardyce began. ‘Robert has had an unfortunate England career by the fact that, when called upon, he made a mistake that has probably haunted him for a while. ‘If he has overcome that, the experience he has gained since should make him a better goalkeeper. And after a difficult time at QPR, he has shone through because of his dedication.’ Green swapped east for west London after West Ham sealed promotion back to the Premier League with a 2-1 play-off final victory over Blackpool. And Allardyce, who was forced to let Green leave on a free transfer due to financial constraints, thinks the keeper will be crucial to QPR’s bid to avoid the drop. ‘Financially we couldn't get there – that was the key element,’ Allardyce said of West Ham’s attempts to keep Green at the club. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce says Green can rival Joe Hart for England No 1 spot . Green faces his old club at Loftus Road on Saturday as QPR bid to beat the drop . ‘It wasn't that Robert didn't want to stay – he did. But we couldn't match, at that time, his financial demands and QPR did. ‘Robert is a dedicated goalkeeper who works tirelessly on his game, and has a huge amount of experience now which, hopefully – not on Saturday – will help QPR stay up.’

RSPCA officers discovered the five illegal pit bull terrier-type dogs at a make-shift  farm in Lancashire where they had been brutally trained to take part in illegal dog fights.

The appalling conditions of a dog training centre where illegal pitbulls covered in scars were forced to wear electric shock collars and train on treadmills has been caught in shocking footage . RSPCA officers discovered the five illegal pit bull terrier-type dogs at a make-shift farm in Lancashire where they had been brutally trained to take part in illegal dog fights . One of the dogs ears had been bitten off. All five illegal dogs - Dingo, Sheeba, Zula, Fenton and Mousey - were ordered to be destroyed . Three men involved in illegal dog fights have been fined a total of £40,000 for a catalogue of appalling animal cruelty offences after RSPCA inspectors raided their homes. All five illegal dogs - Dingo, Sheeba, Zula, Fenton and Mousey - were ordered to be destroyed. Darren Wheatcroft pleaded guilty to attempting to arrange a fight between illegal pit bull terrier-type dogs, while his son, Callan, and farmer Simon Whitworth pleaded guilty to training the animals for fighting. All three were handed suspended prison sentences and ordered to pay a total of £40,000 to the RSPCA at Burnley Magistrates' Court, Lancashire. Footage shown to the court showed some of the animals, which were imported from the Netherlands and trained using treadmills, . Three men involved in illegal dog fights have been fined a total of £40,000 for a catalogue of appalling animal cruelty offences after RSPCA inspectors raided their homes. Darren Wheatcroft (centre) pleaded guilty to attempting to arrange a fight between illegal pit bull terrier-type dogs, while his son, Callan (left), and farmer Simon Whitworth (right) pleaded guilty to training the animals for fighting . Laptops, mobile phones and books were also seized in a joint investigation with Lancashire police known as Operation Cask. Messages were uncovered from Darren Wheatcroft offering a £1,000 fee to secure a fight between his illegal dog and another. District Judge James Clarke slammed dogfighting for its role in 'creating a black market economy' in East Lancashire. He told the defendants: 'These dogs are illegal for a reason. They are dangerous in the eyes of parliament. Their characteristics and their training can lead to significant physical injury to one another and they are dangerous to the public. 'I shouldn't need to remind you that animals such as this have attacked members of your community. While not holding you responsible for that, you have knowingly involved yourself in an industry that perpetuates cruelty and criminality in relation to animals. 'The intention of fighting to the death shows a failure to take proper responsibility of these animals. I am satisfied that his took place over an extended period of time. 'Each of you has an unhealthy interest. You have invested a significant amount of finances and attempted - especially Darren Wheatcroft - to make money out of it, involving others and travelling abroad to acquire the animals. You were involved in criminality.' Darren Wheatcroft, 48, and his son Callan, 22, both of Accrington, admitted keeping and training three of the dogs. Whitworth, 44, of Oswaldtwistle, admitted keeping and training another two dogs. The footage shows the animals were held in electrical shock collars, covered with scars and were kept in urine-soaked cages without water . In his summary of events, RSPCA prosecutor Chris Wyatt said that the animals had a large number of scars. The court also heard home medication kits had been found during the raids . The pitbull type dogs were all seized and ordered to be destroyed by the courts . Darren Wheatcroft admitted a further charge of arranging a dogfight, although the RSPCA could not prove that the event ever took place. Simon Farnsworth, representing the three defendants, said: 'It is not fair to deal with all defendants equally harshly. 'Callan Wheatcroft may well have been involved under the influence of his father.' In his summary of events, RSPCA prosecutor Chris Wyatt said that the animals had a large number of scars. The court also heard home medication kits had been found during the raids. But he added: 'It cannot be proved that these injuries were the result of recent fights or that the defendants were in possession of the dogs when they may have been involved in fights with other animals.' Callan Wheatcroft, a part-time cameraman who films Blackburn Rovers football matches, was given a 16-week prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, and fined £10,000. Father-of-two Whitworth, who works on his parents' farm, was given the same suspended prison sentence but fined £15,000. Married Darren Wheatcroft, who also has a daughter, was handed a 20-week prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, and also fined £15,000. All three, who had originally denied the charges, were ordered to do 150 hours of unpaid community work and banned from keeping dogs for life. Speaking after the hearing, chief inspector Ian Briggs, from the RSPCA's special operations unit, said: 'These people were actively involved in the dogfighting scene. 'They sourced dogs specifically for dogfighting, including going abroad. They were thoroughly knowledgeable in what they were trying to do and they set out deliberately to build up a stock of fighting dogs at their premises. 'We've got the result we wanted and they have been punished accordingly.' An RSPCA spokesman added: 'After fights many dogs are left with horrific injuries and rather than taking them to a vet, dog fighters will perform crude surgeries without anesthetic. Often using staple guns or super glue to close up wounds. 'Most dogs used for fighting will ultimately either be killed in the ring, die as a result of their injuries or in some cases be killed by their owners.' If you suspect someone is taking part in dog fighting, call the RSPCA in confidence on 0300 1234 999 or report it to the police.

// Article: The 19-year-old, named locally as Moses Yitzchok Greenfeld (above) from Stamford hill, London, was pulled from the water in Hampstead Heath, north London, after getting into difficulty while swimming . Police officers 'watched' as a group of teenagers desperately tried to save their friend who drowned in Hampstead Heath pond, it has been claimed. Moses Yitzchok Greenfeld, 19, from Stamford Hill, London, had been swimming with four friends as temperatures reached 25C when he got into difficulty. An eyewitness has said at least seven police officers stood on a bank and watched as the boys dived in and out looking for their friend. The teenagers were reportedly heard shouting to ambulance crews on the side, asking how long someone could survive under water as they scrambled around trying to save their friend. It is thought Mr Greenfield may have had a cardiac arrest because of the shock of jumping into the cold water. His body was eventually discovered five foot below the surface and 20ft from the water's edge just before 11pm on Wednesday - nearly six hours after he was reported in trouble at 5.30pm. James Eisen, a 43-year-old freelance journalist, said: 'I was walking past and I could see a lot of commotion going on over the far side of the pond. 'The guy's friends were going in and out of the water and holding their breath and diving under frantically. 'There were police officers and paramedics and firefighters on the bank just standing there watching while the boys dived under. There was at least seven police officers on the side. 'It was a chaotic and surreal scene. 'I heard one of the boys shouting to one of the ambulance crews and asking how long someone could survive under water without breathing as they continued swimming around in a panic. 'I'm guessing the emergency services are told not to go into the water but if that's the case they probably shouldn't have let the boys carry on swimming about. 'Before I left the police helicopter was flying over and they had launched some boats onto the pond.' Mr Grunfeld's family have paid tribute to the teenager, who they described as a 'wonderful' and 'friendly' man, but said there was no blame because they believed that was the way God was meant to 'take him.' Mr Greenfeld, who is from the Orthodox Jewish community and is thought to have lost his Rabbi father to cancer five years ago, had recently flown home to London from New York, where he was studying religion at a Jewish college. Tragically, he only returned the UK to be with his family during the Passover holiday. His sister, who asked not be named, said: 'He was a wonderful young man and lovely brother who was very well liked, friendly, and he will be dearly missed by his family and friends. 'He was very into studies but he was very fun to be with and he would always try to lend a hand.” Police, specialist divers and 30 firefighters scoured the water for the missing teenager and his body was found five foot below the surface just before 11pm last night. He got into difficulty while swimming with four friends . 'We believe that whatever God does is for the good, so if that’s the way he [God] was meant to take him [Moses] then it must be good for him and for us, because it was meant to be. 'So there’s no blame, no pointing, because what was meant to happen, happened, and there was nothing anybody could have done to avoid it.' Speaking of the police response she added: 'Of course we would have liked it if they could have got their quicker. But we really appreciate what the police have done and they treated us and our religious beliefs with respect. 'They waited for Jewish men to come [to the pond] to handle the body, and we really appreciate that.' The group had been swimming outside of the designated area and out of hours at a time when no lifeguards were on duty, it was claimed. Members of his family gathered at the edge of the large pond – which had been packed in the day with sunbathers – as specialist divers from the Marine Policing Unit and around 30 firefighters scoured the water for him. Emergency services workers could be seen taking a stretcher into the park after the discovery of the body . The tragedy came on the hottest day of the year so far as temperatures reached 25.1C at St James's Park in the capital and in Frittenden, Kent. It is believed Mr Greenfeld may have suffered a heart attack brought on by the sudden change in body temperature after diving into the chilly 8C  pond, the Evening Standard reported. A friend of Mr Greenfeld told the newspaper: 'He arrived with pals after driving up from Hackney. They got here after 5pm and the lifeguard was not on duty. 'I think Moses got into difficulty in the shallow part of the pond but there's a steep drop-off. They recovered his clothes from the side of the pond. 'His mother is devastated. He lost his father to cancer when he was young.' The boys had entered the water after the 4.30pm closure wearing what Mr Eisen described as boxers or swimming shorts. He was seen scrambling in a 10ft deep section of the pond and shouting for help before he disappeared under the surface. Emergency services were called just after 5.30pm and a subsequent search involved 30 firefighters, a police marine unit and a police helicopter. The young man's body was eventually pulled out at about 11pm after extensive searches of the murky water. The heath is controlled by the Corporation of London and a spokesman said that officers had not entered the water to try and save the drowning teenager. Last night, members of Mr Grenfeld's family gathered at the edge of the large pond – which had been packed in the day with sunbathers – as specialist police divers and around 30 firefighters scoured the water for him . Members of the Hatzola team, a group which provides 24/7 emergency care and ambulance services in London, were also called to the scene, along with a police helicopter, specialist divers and about 30 firefighters . A spokesman said: 'The heath constabulary officers are here to enforce bylaws in the park, they are not trained lifeguards and the water is dangerous and very murky, so they are advised they are not to go in until proper assistance arrives. 'He was swimming away from the designated area and out of hours so there were no lifeguards on duty. 'There are signs everywhere warning people not to go into the water at these times. 'Visibility in the water is about six inches, it's very murky, and you can barely see in front of your face. 'He had swum out over a ten foot drop and was about 20 feet from the side when he experienced difficulty - you have to be a strong swimmer to be out there. 'It is a complete tragedy but these are the facts behind it.' The Metropolitan Police confirmed a report was now being prepared for the coroner. The heath was full of sunbathers as the incident unfolded yesterday, as dozens of people had gathered to enjoy the unseasonably warm weather. One man, who claimed to be Mr Grenfeld's uncle, said the teenager had gone swimming with friends. He said: 'He went swimming and he must have struggled and he cannot be found. It's very tragic. They did the surface search and they called it off. The divers are coming in. That will change it from a rescue to a recovery.' Henna Anaya, who was on the heath with her son at the time of the incident, said: 'There were about four friends, all of them in the water, and they were swimming. I told my son they were just messing around. 'The next minute someone said to me he was going down and waving his arm and telling his friend to help, he was sinking. There were guys jumping in to help. The guy who went in told me that police had asked him to get out of the water.' Specialist police divers and around 30 firefighters joined the search for a 19-year-old man who got into difficulty while swimming in Hampstead Ponds in Hampstead Heath, north London, yesterday afternoon . Police were initially called to the scene just after 5.30pm after receiving reports from concerned members of the public that a teenager was in difficulty and under the water. His body was retrieved fromt the lake at 11pm . Another witness, who didn't wish to be named, said: 'It was right at the other end from where the lifeguard would have been, so by the time he was struggling, it would've already been too late. 'One woman said she heard the boys shouting for help, but only realised afterwards because at the time she couldn't understand what they were saying. 'The emergency services arrived very quickly, but you can't make miracles. It's just a tragedy.' Andrew Dutton-Parish, a regular swimmer at the Men's Pond who was also at the heath, added: 'It's such a sad start to the summer. It's very rare for anyone to be drowned.' A London Ambulance Service spokesperson said paramedics arrived on the scene within eight minutes, but the emergency teams, accompanied by a police helicopter, were unable to save the young man. The teenager is the second person to have died while swimming on the heath in the past two years. In August 2013, photographer Sussie Ahlburg, 51, from Holborn, drowned in the ladies' bathing pond. It later emerged she had a heart condition and had been warned not to swim in 'open water' by a cardiologist. Hampstead Heath has three swimming ponds which can become extremely busy in good weather. Despite temperatures reaching 25C in London yesterday, waters remained cool on the heath, with temperatures recorded at about 8C. Hampstead Ponds in Hampstead Heath, north London (pictured), is a popular spot for residents and tourists .

Article: Defiant Stuart McCall on Thursday night urged Rangers to show an immediate response to the first defeat of his tenure and maintain belief in their promotion push. The Ibrox side crashed to a second Championship defeat of the season at Palmerston as Derek Lyle, Gavin Reilly and a Lee Wallace own goal gave Queen of the South’s play-off hopes a massive boost. But McCall is adamant that confidence will not be dented by the scale of the loss and he expects his players to bounce back in Sunday’s home meeting with Raith Rovers. Stuart McCall  urged Rangers to show an immediate response to the first defeat of his tenure . The Ibrox side crashed to a second Championship defeat of the season at Palmerston . ‘We’ve already spoken about going into the play-offs with good momentum,’ said McCall. ‘Tonight is a set-back but we’ve got to make sure on Sunday that we don’t have another set-back or then it can become a problem. ‘We will be fully focused on Sunday and we will be looking for the three points. ‘There will be no confidence factor come Sunday — I can assure you of that. Sometimes you get beat and you just have to hold your hands up and give credit to the opposition. ‘I was pleased with certain things leading up to their first goal. I thought we were doing well. ‘I said to the lads that we will put a line under it. Yeah, we know we weren’t good tonight but we will be good on Sunday.’ Rangers remain third in the table — behind Hibernian on goal difference but with a game in hand — after what was their biggest-ever loss to Queens. ‘Fair play to them,’ said McCall, who expects Cammy Bell to be fit to face Raith after a minor knee injury. ‘They were clinical when they had their chances. New manager McCall (right) suffered his first defeat since taking charge of the Ibrox club . Striker Derek Lyle points to the skies after putting Queen of the South in the lead at Palmerston Park . Lewis Kidd celebrates after doubling Queen of the South's lead at the start of the second half . ‘We controlled large parts of the first half but they got a lot of good blocks in. It’s about scoring goals and they got the first one. ‘Then we lost a goal that was really poor defending straight from the kick-off. Then you are chasing the game and that suited them with their pace on the counter attack. ‘We had some chances in the second half but we never really did enough. We weren’t good enough to win the game but we move on. ‘I’ve said it before and I will say it again, there will be ups and downs between now and the end of the season. It’s how we react to it, and Sunday can’ t come quickly enough for me.’ Jubilant Queen of the South boss James Fowler was thrilled with a result that saw his team leapfrog Falkirk into that crucial fourth place in the Championship standings. ‘We were backs to the wall a wee bit in the first half,’ admitted Fowler. ‘But we managed to cope with that. We got the goal and then getting another one so early in the second half was great. ‘All the players were great and we are pushing hard.’

Article: A family overheard a terrifying message on their young son's baby monitor after the device and its camera were hacked. When the Washington couple's three-year-old had first began complaining of someone talking to him at night, his parents had put it down to their toddler's over-active imagination, reported CBS New York. That was until one night when they heard a strange man's voice come over the monitor to tell their son: 'Wake up little boy, daddy's looking for you.' A couple heard the terrifying message: 'Wake up little boy, daddy's looking for you' come through their 3-year-old son's baby monitor (stock image) And the horrified parents, who do not want to be named for fear the unknown man could track them down, believe it is not just the audio monitor that has been hacked. They believe the stranger has also got into the camera on the device. After the first creepy message, the boy's mother had walked into the room and overheard the hacker saying, 'Look someone's coming' or 'Someone's coming into view.' The mother said she broke down in tears after the realization hit home that a total stranger was able to control the camera to watch their son and spy on them. The stranger had managed to hack the baby monitor and the family says the hacker was even able to remotely control the camera on the monitor (stock image) She told CBS New York: 'Well, I started to cry in there, because it all started coming back to me, and I started figuring things out.' They reported the incident to Foscam, the company where they bought their monitor, who admitted it was possible the device's cameras were being controlled remotely but they could not say from where. Technology experts have now warned that it is becoming easier for hackers to infiltrate family's baby monitors as many of the newer devices connect to the internet. 'It's basically like they're standing next to you in your house,' Lance Ulanoff, chief correspondent for the digital media website Mashable,CBS. He warned that parents should change the passwords on the devices to make it more difficult for people to guess. Because some new baby monitors connect to the internet and come with a smartphone app, it has become easier for hackers to infiltrate them and listen in or speak to children . 'If somebody else has your login information, they can go to that same app, and log into your webcam, which is what happened here,' Ulanoff said. Earlier this month, another couple - this time from Rochester, Minnesota - discovered their baby monitors and cameras had been infiltrated after they found footage from the nanny cam posted online, according to Redbook. They first became suspicious after they heard music coming in from their baby's room. 'We were sleeping in bed, and basically heard music coming from the nursery, but then when we went into the room the music turned off,' she told KTTC. When she tracked down the IP address which was streaming the music, she found a web link to a page with thousands of pictures from baby monitors all over the world, including several from her own child's nursery. 'There's at least fifteen different countries listed and it's not just nurseries—it's people's living rooms, their bedrooms, their kitchens,' she explained. 'Every place that people think is sacred and private in their home is being accessed.'

Article: Heartwarming photos have emerged of a man rescuing five beloved horses from the severe flooding in his rural town triggered by the worst storm in a decade in New South Wales. Steve Spowart helped the horses' owner, Sonia Sharrock, to lead the animals to safety near Dungog, in the NSW Hunter region - one of the hardest hit areas in the state - where three people died in the severe weather, four houses were washed away and the town received the most rainfall it had in 100 years. Mr Spowart, in a black wetsuit, paddled out on his surfboard to where the horses were stranded, past trees, bushes and fences submerged in the floodwater that was almost as high as his shoulders. Scroll down for video . Steve Spowart rescues five horses from flood water on April 22 near Dungog, a small town in the NSW Hunter Valley region . Mr Spowart paddled out to where the horses were stranded, with concentration etched on his face . His tough journey to save the animals was captured as he paddled past submerged trees and bushes . As he managed to get hold of a brown horse in what was once a field surrounded by a fence, the man clung to its mane to lead it to safety . The moving images show the concentration on his face as he moves towards the animals and his concern as he struggles to lead them out of the deep murky water. In one photo, a startled brown horse attempts to flee as the man is kicked backwards into the water. The man and owner Ms Sharrock, in a green jacket, then appear to try and calm the animal to coax it to come with them without any reins. A young boy with a tin motor boat waits in shallow water as they walk a chestnut and two white horses out of the flood. The brown horse reared up after becoming caught in barbed wire, splashing and throwing the man back into the storm water . The brown horse stood off against the two rescuers, Sonia Sharrock and Mr Spowart, in fear of the terrifying floods . The man was helped by two women as he led two white and one chestnut horse out of the deep water towards a young boy and a boat . On Wednesday morning, the NSW Premier called on flood victims to 'hang tough' as the storm slowly moved down the south coast. 'Obviously, in the areas particularly impacted in the Hunter, Newcastle and across the Central Coast, we ask those communities to hang tough,' Mr Baird said. He said 'areas such as Dungog and Maitland, parts of the Central Coast' would be declared natural disaster zones but a state of emergency would not be announced. The community of Dungog in the Hunter region is said to be in 'shock' after three residents who died in dangerous weather conditions on Tuesday were identified as Robyn McDonald, aged about 70, Colin Webb, 79, and Brian Wilson, 72, the Newcastle Herald reported. The SES says it has had about 8000 requests for help and conducted 90 flood rescues since Monday, and about 200,000 homes and businesses remain without power. More than 260 SES crews and 600 volunteers will be out in the field on Wednesday. The barefooted man looked more relieved as he held on tightly to one horse's rein after emerging from the water . Ms Sharrock, in a green coat, talks to a chestnut horse as it follows her to safety out of the storm water in Dungog . A small smile crosses her face as she gets on to shallow ground with her animals . The white horse stands tall amidst the stormy skies in Dungog, an area that has been hit especially hard by the storm . The man carried ropes and reins on his surfboard as he made his way to the horses . As Mr Spowart walked out of the water, there was an eerie calm while the rain continued to fall .

Article: A fiery stoush has erupted between the chief executive of Rupert Murdoch's media empire in Australia and a senator who questioned why the company runs a national newspaper at a multi-million dollar loss. During a tumultuous day of proceedings at a corporate tax inquiry in Sydney today, News Corp Australia CEO Julian Clarke was peppered with questions from Greens senator and party leader Christine Milne about why The Australian newspaper operates as a business when it is not profitable. When Mr Clarke defended the newspaper as the 'finest national newspaper operating in Australia', Ms Milne flatly told the inquiry, 'you and I won't agree on that'. 'You're a minority,' Mr Clarke fired back. 'Not from the number of people who buy your newspaper,' Ms Milne responded. Scroll down for video . A fiery stoush erupted News Corp Australia CEO Julian Clarke and a senator who questioned why the company runs a national newspaper at a multi-million dollar loss . Clarke was peppered with questions from Greens senator Christine Milne about why The Australian newspaper continued to when it is not profitable . As Christine Milne made her opinion about The Australian newspaper clear, News Corp Australia CEO Julian Clarke fired back: 'You're a minority' 'Not according to sales,' Greens Senator Christine Milne responded . 'I'm sorry?' Mr Clarke asked. 'How many do we sell a day? 'You sell a very small number,' Ms Milne responded. Mr Clarke also rejected allegations recently published by Fairfax Media alleging $4.5 billion had been siphoned from Mr Murdoch's Australian operations to the United States virtually tax free. He told the hearing the report was 'hopelessly wrong', arguing the stories were 'either deliberately misleading or no idea; looking at the author (business correspondent Michael West), I would say both'. In her questioning, Ms Milne also alleged The Australian was run for ideological purposes. Mr Clarke, who argued the paper examined policy, accepted her contention. It has been previously reported that the national broadsheet lost $30 million in the 2012/13 financial year. The paper was reportedly hoping to half that loss in the 2013/14 financial year. Also at Wednesday's hearing, the inquiry panel heard that the Australian arms of technology giants Google, Apple and Microsoft are being audited by the Australian Tax Office. Google Australia's managing director Maile Carnegie (centre), Microsoft's Bill Semple and Apple Australia Vice President Tony King are pictured fronting today's inquiry . Google Australia's managing director Maile Carnegie (left), Apple Australia Vice President Tony King  and Microsoft's Bill Semple appear at the inquiry . Committee chair Sam Dastyari is pictured listening on as the three tech giants argued their case before the inquiry . Executives from the three major companies confirmed that they were being investigated. Google Australia managing director Maile Carnegie said the company made $58 million in revenue in 2013, and profits of just more than $46 million, but paid $7.1 million in tax. Earlier, Tax Commissioner Chris Jordan continued to refuse to reveal the identities of a number of companies suspected of avoiding tax by shifting billions of dollars offshore. Committee chairman Sam Dastyari had written to Mr Jordan on Tuesday requesting he reveal the names. But Mr Jordan refused, and in a response sent to Senator Dastyari and tabled at the hearing on Wednesday, defended the decision on the grounds that naming the companies would undermine public confidence in the tax system. 'The Treasurer has been consulted about making these PII (public interest immunity) claims, and has endorsed them being made by me as an independent statutory office holder. The grounds of the PII claim are as follows,' the letter said. 'Disclosure of the information will have a substantial adverse effect on the proper and efficient operations of the ATO, contrary to the public interest.'

Article: David Cameron will put small business at the heart of the election campaign today by declaring that the Conservatives are ‘the party of the grafters’. The Prime Minister, who has faced criticism over a campaign lacking in passion, said he made ‘no apology’ for focusing on the economy, insisting: ‘Nothing matters more.’ He will appeal to small firms and the self-employed, saying while Labour sneers at those who work hard, his party backs them. Scroll down for video . David Cameron will put small business at the heart of the election campaign today by declaring that the Conservatives are ‘the party of the grafters’ Yesterday, Mr Cameron defended his campaign against criticism it is too narrow. ‘If you want political excitement, maybe you could go to Greece,’ he said. ‘That’s an exciting country, I am told. I don’t think that’s exciting – I think that’s terrifying. ‘When you get a new job, a new home, get a new childcare place or start a new business... now that’s truly exciting. If you want to take a risk, vote for the other man. My God, he’s got plenty of risks.’ He said Labour’s ‘disastrous’ plans for higher taxes and borrowing would risk the stability of people’s lives. And he told voters: ‘I want you to think about the three million low-paid people we have taken out of income tax, I want you to think about the two million jobs that we have created, I want you to think of the cuts in youth unemployment that we’ve achieved. I want you to think of that and I want you to take that argument that Labour make and stick it where the sun don’t shine.’ Mr Cameron went on: ‘Some people are saying to me, “You are putting too much emphasis on a strong and stable economy and securing our future”. I plead guilty.’ The Tories will today unveil a separate manifesto for small businesses, calling them ‘the lifeblood of the economy’. Thousands of small business leaders will back the party in an open letter. The Prime Minister, who has faced criticism over a campaign lacking in passion, said he made ‘no apology’ for focusing on the economy, insisting: ‘Nothing matters more’ And Mr Cameron – who is understood to have ordered that all campaigning activity is now dedicated to the economy – will set out new proposals to support millions of small firms and self-employed. He is to promise tax breaks and start-up loans, and an end to another £10billion-worth of red tape, to enable the creation of 600,000 businesses a year. The Tories are also promising to review the disadvantages faced by the self-employed, who make up 15 per cent of the workforce. In an echo of the campaign rhetoric of Margaret Thatcher, who famously celebrated Napoleon’s supposed dismissal of Britain as a ‘nation of shopkeepers’, Mr Cameron will say: ‘Small businesses are the backbone of our economy – and Conservatives are behind them 100 per cent. We’re the party of the grafters and the roofers and the retailers and the plumbers. ‘We get them, we respect them, we understand them, we back them. Where Labour sneer, we cheer.’

Article: Ed Miliband was last night accused of snubbing Britain’s army of self-employed workers – for refusing to send them a special Election message. The Labour leader prompted claims that he was worried about upsetting his party’s ‘union paymasters’. In a special Election edition, the magazine of the respected Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed (IPSE) carries tributes from nearly every major party leader to people who work for themselves. Scroll down for video . No message: Ed Miliband was last night accused of snubbing Britain’s army of self-employed workers – for refusing to send them a special Election message in the IPSE magazine . But while David Cameron, Nick Clegg, Nigel Farage and Nicola Sturgeon all feature, there is no message from Mr Miliband. Instead, the magazine has pointedly published a blank page where his contribution would have been – with a sharp rebuke. It reads: ‘Despite repeated requests, Labour leader Ed Miliband decided not to take up IPSE’s offer to outline his views on the UK’s 4.5 million self-employed.’ Last night, IPSE chief executive Chris Bryce said: ‘We were disappointed that Mr Miliband didn’t take up our offer to engage with this vibrant community.’ Refused to contribute: While David Cameron, Nick Clegg, Nigel Farage and Nicola Sturgeon all feature, there is no message from Mr Miliband in the magazine . But one leading self-employed businessman said: ‘Labour depends on union subscriptions for funding and in reality, few of the self-employed are union members. This is not so much a slap in the face to the self-employed as a left hook.’ Labour last night denied it had delivered a snub. A party spokesman said: ‘We want to do all we can to ensure a better deal for self-employed people.’ But the Conservatives and Lib Dems seized on the row. Tory chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Some of our greatest success stories started with a self-employed person and an idea. 'Ed Miliband’s approach is to snub enterprising people and tax them into the ground.’ Lib Dem Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander said: ‘This is another Labour slap in the face for the millions of self-employed who bring energy and dynamism to our economy. This is a vital sector that deserves respect and admiration. ‘Every time figures show this sector is growing, Labour sneer.’

Article: We spend a third of our lives asleep, but most of us don't pay attention to what our mind and body actually need during these resting hours in order to feel refreshed every day. The Sleep Health Foundation have released a study reporting that 30 percent of Australians complain about their lack of sleep on a daily basis. According to Chair Professor David Hillman, those misplaced hours of sleep must be paid back in order to be functional for the entire week. A study has outlined that 30 percent of Australians complain about their lack of sleep on a daily basis . The average adult needs around eight hours of sleep per night with a range of seven to nine . The average amount of sleep for an adult is around eight hours, with a range of seven to nine, the ABC have reported. Any less than six hours or any more than 10 hours is unusual for the standard person. Professor Hillman added that our sleep pattern is influenced by how much we are willing to compromise from the work week. 'A lot of us pay back a bit of that debt on the weekend but I think it's possible to exist in a sort of tolerable, sleep-restricted state,' he said. 'In other words you're not optimal, but you're still functional.' Pushing these sleep-debt boundaries can lead to micro sleeps in certain people. Therefore, the hours must be paid back to avoid an error rate in alertness tasks. Any less than six or any more than ten hours is unusual for the standard person . If power napping, it is important to get no more than 20 minutes or inertia will set in . In relation to a sleep schedule, Professor Hillman said the eight hours per night does not necessarily need to be consecutive. 'Interestingly enough, your slow wave sleep, is in the first four hours,' he said. 'Most adults, the most convenient way our particular society is organised is to have your eight hours in a continuous block overnight but that's not a necessary thing.' If choosing to break up your eight hours of sleep, napping throughout the day is the answer. Professor Hillman advises 20 minute power naps to avoid falling into deep sleep and suffering from inertia which makes you feel temporarily worse off. 'The longer naps, you get the sleep inertia but ultimately once you've got up, they sustain you better,' he said. Professor Hillman has also advised that if you are waking up tired and fatigued it could be due to sleep apnoea which is often associated with snoring.

He suffered from minor bumps and bruises and was listed in stable condition at the hospital . He is listed in stable condition after being taken to MetroHealth Medical Center and suffered from minor bruises and bumps. The boy's leg was injured in the fall, but he was not attacked by the animals, Dr. Christopher Kuhar, the zoo's executive director told Fox 8. Michael Lurie and his family were at the Cheetah exhibit when they heard the child scream. 'You saw how far the drop was and you just couldn't believe the kid didn't hurt himself from falling down on the ground,' Lurie told WKYC. 'I was just shocked,' he said. 'I didn't understand how the parents let the kid go over the thing.' The cheetahs did not approach the boy or his parents while in the pit, according to zoo officials. Zoo visitor Terra Lurie believes the boy was not approached by the fast feline because they were frightened. 'I think they were just curious as to what was going on and why somebody was in the pen with them,' she said. 'It's not every day that somebody is just in the pen with them.' 'And everyone else is screaming and they probably got scared.' Kuhar said the zoo had received 'a number of eyewitness accounts' that indicate the 'strong likelihood that the child was dangled over the railing,' he told NewsNet5.

Spurs plan to open a new 'world-class' 56,000-seater stadium in just over three years time, and having secured the appropriate planning permission and fought off a legal challenge against a compulsory purchase order, progress is being made. The north London club's neighbours, Archway Sheet Metal Works, fought a long court battle with Tottenham over the development but having failed with an appeal earlier this year, their premises are beginning to be demolished. Tottenham Hotspur are moving forward with the next step towards their new stadium development . The final opponent to Tottenham's £400million move, Archway Sheet Metal Works, is being demolished . The new stadium development (bottom) got given the go ahead after Archway lost a long-running court battle . A former factory belonging to Archway Sheet Metal Works begins to be pulled down behind the North Stand . Tottenham flags fly in front of the already partly-demolished building in north London on Thursday . April 2008 - Spurs began investigations into the Wingate industrial estate adjacent to White Hart Lane with a view to stadium expansion. December 2008 - Designs for the new stadium are unveiled. An intended completion date of the start of the 2012-13 season was revealed by Daniel Levy. April 2009 - Tottenham announce they will issue 30m new shares to raise £15m for the first stage of the proposed development. October 2009 - Planning application to Haringey Council is submitted. May 2010 - Tottenham withdraw planning application and submit a revised plan. March 2013 - West Ham are confirmed as Olympic Stadium tenants and Tottenham focus all attentions on the current project. April 2013 - Public Inquiry is held about last remaining properties to be acquired. July 2014 - Secretary of State Eric Pickles grants compulsory purchase order for the last piece of land. February 2015 - Archway are informed there is no legal flaw in Tottenham's compulsory purchase order, removing the final hurdle. April 2015 - Archway begins to be demolished. Diggers have moved in to knock down some of the buildings in Paxton Road that back on to White Hart Lane's North Stand ahead of the major regeneration project that is expected to cost in the region of £400million. The rest will be demolished when Archway find a new premises. Archway asked a judge to quash Communities Secretary Eric Pickles' decision to confirm the CPO on the grounds that it was 'unlawful and invalid' but were told earlier this year that there was 'no legal flaw' in the decision-making process. The Metal Works was were denied permission to appeal but they were allowed to directly ask Court of Appeal judges to reconsider the case, although they did not take up the option. That meant Spurs could finally secure the last patch of land needed to start work on the new stadium that they hope will rival that of north London rivals Arsenal. The plan for the design of the stadium itself includes a one-tier stand - similar to Liverpool's famous Kop - at one end, and will be bowl-shaped in a similar style to  Arsenal's Emirates Stadium. The project further aims to regenerate the Tottenham area with a central square, shops, housing and the refurbishment of existing buildings included in the club's plans. Last November, a mystery fire gutted the Archway premises, which is alongside White Hart Lane's North Stand. The owners also say they received 'bomb threats'.

Article: The CEO of Salesforce.com has announced the company is now attempting to transfer any Indiana employee who is 'uncomfortable' with the polarizing new Religious Freedom Restoration Act out of the state. The law, brought in by Indiana Governor Mike Pence, was supposed to satisfy evangelicals but has sparked boycotts of the state, amid fears that it would allow legalized discrimination against lesbians and gays. Marc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce, was one of the first corporate executives to react to the polarizing bill, calling it 'brutal' and 'unjust' and saying he was finding ways to reduce investments in Indiana. He initially canceled all events and suspended employee travel to the state. Speaking out: Marc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce who was one of the first corporate executives to react to Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, is now trying to relocate state employees who are uncomfortable . However on Wednesday he told CNN Money he was now responding to employee complaints that they no longer want to work and live in the state, and is trying to find ways to help them. It is the most aggressive corporate reaction to the controversial legislation yet. 'I just got an email ... from another employee who said, ''look I don't feel comfortable living in this state anymore, you have to move me out,'' and I gave him a $50,000 relocation package and said, ''great, you're clear to go''.' Benioff was sure to point out that he will not be able to shut down the Salesforce sector in Indiana completely. The San Francisco-based tech company, which offers ‘customer relationship management’ to other companies, has a total 2,000 employees in the state. A number of companies — including Salesforce, EMC and Cloudera — have already withdrawn their sponsorships for Indy Big Data, a tech conference scheduled in May. Change: Benioff tweeted Friday in response to Indiana lawmakers saying Friday morning they had amended the already-in-effect law, clarifying that no one will 'be able to discriminate against anyone at any time' Benioff's announcement follows one made by Apple CEO Tim Cook. On Monday Cook condemned the laws, saying they were 'very dangerous', went against the founding principles of America, and would take the country back to the days of 'Whites Only' signs in shop doorways. He added that, as a Baptist, he supports religious freedom, but said: 'I was never taught, nor do I believe, that religion should be used as an excuse to discriminate.' Cook, 54, who came out as gay in October last year, made the comments in an op-ed for the Washington Post. He wrote: 'In total, there are nearly 100 bills designed to enshrine discrimination in state law. 'On behalf of Apple, I'm standing up to oppose this new wave of legislation. 'These bills under consideration truly will hurt jobs, growth and the economic vibrancy of parts of the country where a 21st-century economy was once welcomed with open arms.' He also addressed legislation in Texas that 'would strip the salaries and pensions of clerks who issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.' Taking a stance: Openly-gay Apple CEO Tim Cook criticized new laws that critics say will allow business owners to openly discriminate . Cook said such bills 'rationalize injustice' by 'pretending to defend' religious freedom, which actually eroding the freedoms of others. Cook drew upon his background growing up in the South in the 1960s and 1970s, during and immediately after the Civil Rights movement when blacks were still heavily discriminated against. He says America's 'days of discrimination' must remain 'deep in the past' and said freedom and equality is a value that is at the heart of his company. He added: 'Apple is open. Open to everyone, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, how they worship or who they love.' Indiana's religious freedom act says that the state and local government 'may not substantially burden a person's right to the exercise of religion' unless that burden is 'essential' to furthering a government interest. It will be up to the courts to decide what counts as 'substantial', but the legislation was largely designed to fend off lawsuits against those who refuse to participate in gay marriage ceremonies. For example a florist who refuses to supply flowers for a same sex ceremony. Supporters say that such provisions already exist in 20 other states, and were actually signed into federal law by Bill Clinton in 1993. But opponents, including Cook, claim these laws form part of a wave of discriminatory powers that threaten to reverse years of progress on equality issue . The Indiana bill forbids the state or local government from 'substantially burdening' a person's religious beliefs unless that burden is 'essential' to further a 'compelling' government interest, and is the 'least restrictive' means of achieving that aim. It allows people or organisations to use the legislation as a defense in court against claims of discrimination against them, and if the court rules in their favor, allows reparations, including compensation payouts. It will be up to the courts and judges to decide what constitutes 'substantial', but critics fear that the broad scope of the law and the tough tests that must be passed to override it, mean that it will allow business owners to openly discriminate in how they operate. Cook is far from the only one opposing the new law in Indiana, with musician Miley Cyrus, and actors Ashton Kutcher, James Van Der Beek and George Takei all speaking out against it. The NBA, WNBA, the Indiana Pacers, and Indiana Fever issued a joint statement Saturday reaffirming their commitment to non-discrimination. Hillary Clinton also messaged to her three million Twitter followers saying that 'we shouldn't discriminate against people because of who they love' following the bill's passing on Thursday. Businesses are also lining up to oppose the legislation, threatening to pull investment or even boycott the state altogether in protest. Fighting back: Demonstrators gathered to protest a controversial religious freedom bill recently signed by Indiana Governor Mike Pence during a rally in Indianapolis on Saturday . Website Angie's List also announced plans to cancel a $40 million expansion to its Indianapolis headquarters because of the new law. 'Angie's List is open to all and discriminates against none and we are hugely disappointed in what this bill represents,' the company's CEO Bill Oesterle said in the statement. Thousands gathered outside the Indiana Statehouse on Saturday to rally against the law, waving rainbow coloured flags and chanting slogans such as 'no hate in our state'. Since the law passed, Republican Senator Mike Pence has robustly defended it, saying that it is necessary to help people defend themselves against 'government overreach'. He also ruled out any possibility of repealing the law, which is due to take effect in July, telling This Week with George Stephanopoulos, that 'the law will stick.' Marching: Thousands gathered outside the Indiana Statehouse on Saturday to hold a rally against the new law, which forbids the government from 'substantially burdening' a person's religious beliefs .

Article: Chris Smalling says Manchester United have Arsenal and Chelsea in their sights following their resounding victory over champions Manchester City. United are third, eight points behind leaders Chelsea, who they face on Saturday and play second placed Arsenal in their penultimate league game. Smalling scored United's fourth goal in their 4-2 derby demolition. It means he has now scored the same amount of Premier League goals this season as former teammate Danny Welbeck at Arsenal with four. Chris Smalling showed his hunger to beat a lethargic City defence to Ashley Young's free-kick . Smalling is greeted by Juan Mata following his goal in Manchester United's impressive win over their rivals . He said: 'It’s massive [to win six in a row]. I think a lot of people probably saw our fixtures as the hardest of the lot, but if you play teams like Tottenham and Liverpool and win, they’re real six-pointers. It makes a massive difference, and I think confidence comes from beating these top teams. 'We weren’t ourselves in the first 15 minutes, but we dominated from there on. 'We came in at half-time and Giggsy said it was a good show of character to come back from a goal down, but in the second half we needed to get the ball down and take a few more risks. Mata once again showed his value to the side and pointed the way with a display full of energy and poise . 'We were a bit cautious and didn’t try to play out [from the back] too much, but in the second half we really kicked on and made a print on the game. Smalling ghosted into the area unmarked to head Ashley Young's free-kick past Joe Hart on 73 minutes. Wayne Rooney leaps onto Marouane Fellaini's back after United took the lead through the big Belgian . 'I wanted to try to get a run on early; I was ready to pop up and it finished the game,' he added. 'I think today put us up another step and I think we’re on a roll; we can look up the table and not behind us. 'You could sense even from the warm-up that the atmosphere was going to be special. We lost against City earlier in the season so today was massive and I think the fans really stuck with us.' All of United's outfield players celebrate as they gave noisy neighbours Manchester City .

Article: A helicopter hero travelled 23,000 miles to find every chopper he had ever flown - only to find one had been converted into a posh camping facility. Jerry Grayson, who lives in Melbourne but is originally from Arundel, Sussex, set himself the task of tracking down every aircraft he ever flew as part of Royal Navy rescue missions during the 1970s. The 59-year-old, who now designs aerial stunts for films, was once the youngest pilot to join the navy and was responsible for saving 15 yachtsmen during the doomed Fastnet Yacht Race in 1979. Former Royal Navy rescue pilot Jerry Grayson, who was involved in rescuing sailors during the Fastnet Yacht Rescue in 1979 (pictured), has tracked down every aircraft he flew in during the 1970s . After travelling 23,000 miles, including from his home in Melbourne, Mr Grayson found that one of the choppers had been turned into a glamping unit - a popular style of camping for posh campers . The Wessex Mark 1 (pictured) now resides between a gypsy caravan and an old Routemaster bus in Blackberry Wood campsite near Ditchling, Sussex . During his mission, Mr Grayson found that most of the helicopters had been blown up in target practice or turned into museum pieces. But he discovered that one chopper, a Wessex Mark 1, has been kitted out as a so-called 'glamping' unit, accommodation for campers who want something more luxurious than a traditional tent. The Mark 1, called Wessex XS 886, now resides between a gypsy caravan and an old Routemaster bus in Blackberry Wood campsite near Ditchling, Sussex. Mr Grayson said: 'It's bizarre that it's now being used to sleep in. If I'd fallen asleep in a Mark 1 35 years ago, it would have cost me my life. It didn't feel like three decades ago that I'd last set foot inside. 'But when I looked at all the switches and dials I realised I can't remember how to start the thing.' Mr Grayson's journey took him all around the UK. He is pictured at the International Helicopter Museum in Weston-Super-Mare . He also tracked down another chopper at Gunsmoke Paintball in Hadleigh, near Ipswich - where it is used as part of the course . The tour also took him to another paintball site in Bawtry Fields, Doncaster, where he found another aircraft . The helicopter may be fitted with beds, curtains and cushioned seats. But, between 1977 and 1979, Mr Grayson flew in the aircraft for six rescues out of his base in Cornwall. He said: 'We used to save people from the cliff sides. Things like children in dinghies being blow out to sea or surfers suffering with the bends. 'Once we rescued a woman who had injured herself after falling off the cliff near a theatre. The whole cast of A Midsummer Night's Dream watched as we did it.' Mr Grayson, who is writing a book about his experiences, pictured with the helicopter in which he learned to fly at the age of 17 . The former pilot at Whittington Barracks, Staffordshire (left) and Taskforce Paintball, Cowbridge, South Wales . One of two helicopters that Mr Grayson found at the Fleet Air Arm Museum in Yeovilton . Mr Grayson's interest in retracing his old aircraft was piqued when he found a website, created by a former pilot, which spoke out previous experiences. The pair got in touch and began swapping stories. And as he dug deeper into the history of the helicopters, he decided to make one last visit to each one to see what had happened to them. His trip then took him from Melbourne to several parts of the UK, including London, Sussex, Doncaster, Cambridge, Ipswich, Yeovilton and Newport. He said: 'The natural cycle of life is that a helicopter first serves its time in a front line role and then gets allocated to a second line role such as training or SAR. He was awarded with Air Forces Cross by the Queen for outstanding gallantry in search and rescue. Pictured: Mr Grayson flying a helicopter, as smoke pours out . By the age of 25, he had become the most decorated naval pilot in peacetime. Pictured: Mr Grayson flying a Wessex 1 from HMS Ark Royal during the height of the Cold War . Mr Grayson, pictured at the controls of a Wessex 5, joined the Fleet Air Arm in 1972 aged 17. It made him the youngest helicopter pilot to serve in the Royal Navy . 'It then serves one final useful role as a teaching tool for young engineers or for airport fire services. 'As most of these aircraft were built in the early 60s the only surprise was that out of the 31 Wessex helicopters I used for rescues there are still 12 in existence.' Mr Grayson joined the Fleet Air Arm in 1972 aged 17. It made him the youngest helicopter pilot to serve in the Royal Navy. By the age of 25 he had become the most decorated naval pilot in peacetime and was awarded with Air Forces Cross by the Queen for outstanding gallantry in search and rescue. As well as being a rescuer during Fastnet, Mr Grayson has previously gone head-to-head with Russian submarines and was entrusted with carrying the key for a nuclear weapon aged just 19. He now designs shoots and aerial stunts for films, including Black Hawk Down. He is writing about his latest experience for his book 'Rescue Pilot: Cheating the Sea'.

Article: Beef at a good price . If Ian Botham is going to watch his Test wickets record get beaten by Jimmy Anderson, he might as well earn himself a bit of cash doing it. After spotting that SkyBet were offering 9/4 on the Lancashire seamer to take four wickets in the first innings on Wednesday morning, Beefy, who remains England’s leading wicket-taker for the time being with 383, tweeted: ‘I’ll have a go at that price!!!’ Sir Ian Botham was tempted to bet on Jimmy Anderson breaking his record on the third morning in Antigua . Daddy’s girl . With Botham’s record in his sights, all eyes at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium were on Anderson — including those of his wife Daniella and daughter Ruby Luxe. But the Burnley Express kept everyone waiting, and watching Test cricket can be a hard slog for anyone — let alone a four-year-old. Anderson's wife Daniella and daughter watch the action from the stands at the Sir Viv Richards Stadium . Swanny’s funny . While tributes were paid to Anderson on Test Match Special at lunch, former team-mate Graeme Swann revealed how he used to wind him up. ‘It was great when his face was on the back of all of those London buses last year — just so I could say to him “You’ve got a face like the back of a bus”,’ said Swann. Anderson picked up one wicket on day three, but is still one shy of Botham's record of 383 dismissals . Moeen spinning in . The ECB announced on Wednesday that Moeen Ali has been called up for the next Test in Grenada. The question is, where will he fit into the first XI with off-spinner James Tredwell bowling so well? It would be embarrassing for Moeen if he was kept out of the England team by a man who can’t get into his own county side. Moeen Ali, pictured playing for Worcestershire, has been added to the England squad for the remaining Tests . Blackwood frustrates Ben . By far the most interesting on-pitch battle was between Ben Stokes and Jermaine Blackwood. The West Indies’ sixth man in scored 112 in the first innings, much to the frustration of Stokes — and not just because of the eight boundaries the Jamaican hit off him. After Tuesday’s no-ball episode, Stokes narrowly missed out on Blackwood’s wicket twice on Wednesday  — seeing an edge dropped by James Tredwell at slip, followed by a close lbw denial upheld by the third umpire. Jermaine Blackwood hit his maiden Test match century in his sixth match for the West Indies on Wednesday . Ben Stokes was frustrated twice when he thought he dismissed Blackwood, adding to Tuesday's no-ball . Five-star Jos . Tredwell rightly took the plaudits on day three, but Jos Buttler put in a tidy performance with the gloves. The Lancashire wicketkeeper took five catches for the first time in a Test innings. He’s only the second keeper to do so against West Indies, after Jack Russell in 1990. Jos Buttler took five catches for the first time in a Test innings, only the second England 'keeper to do so . Looking hot, man . During lulls in the proceedings, fans were treated to dancing from the excellently-costumed Seaweed man. He certainly kept spirits up among members of the crowd, but that outfit doesn’t look tailor-made for the Antiguan 30-degree heat. A spectator known as Seaweed man watches the action on day three of the first Test in Antigua .

Article: Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (CNN)Lost luggage after a long flight is a common, frustrating occurrence of modern air travel. And sometimes, airlines lose things that are irreplaceable. American Jennifer Stewart says she was devastated to learn that Etihad Airways lost her most important baggage following a recent trip from Abu Dhabi to New York City: her 2-year-old pet cat, Felix. Stewart said that she and her husband, Joseph Naaman, booked Felix on their Etihad Airways flight from the United Arab Emirates to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport on April 1. Shortly after the plane arrived in New York that evening, Felix went missing somewhere on the grounds of Kennedy Airport, according to Etihad Airways. Felix was able to get loose, Stewart said she believes, because the cat's plastic carrier was badly damaged at some point either during the flight or the transfer from the airplane to the pickup area. Stewart said a cargo manager called the couple to an office after they landed at Kennedy last week and notified them that their cat's carrier had been crushed. Photographs taken by Stewart showed a large hole in the top of the cat's carrier. At least one of the corners of the case appeared partially collapsed. Nearly one week later, Felix remains missing. "For them to take a cat and ship him like he was cargo, not a live animal, makes me sick," Stewart said.  "You trust that people care and are doing the job well, and then this happens." A representative for Etihad Airways told CNN that that the loss of pets during air travel is "extremely rare."  The airline shipped more than 200 pets last year. Etihad Airways is investigating the incident and is working with ground handlers at the New York airport to help locate the missing cat. The Abu Dhabi-based carrier also said it hired "third-party specialists" to help in the hunt for Felix. "We deeply regret this unfortunate incident and are keeping the owner apprised of the progress of the search," Etihad Airways told CNN in a statement. "We will review our pet handling procedures in the wake of this incident, as the safety and care of pets traveling with Etihad Airways is a top priority." Stewart and her husband booked the cat's flight as part of their job relocation to the United States after living in Abu Dhabi for more than three years. The couple said they spent $1,200 to ship Felix on the 14-hour flight. "You pay all of this money, but for what? People assume you pay extra to have your pets taken care of, but they're treated no differently than a free piece of checked luggage," Stewart said. It isn't the first time a pet has gone missing at New York's busiest airport. In August 2011, a cat escaped from its carrier before an American Airlines flight from New York to San Francisco. That cat was eventually discovered -- alive -- two months later in a customs room at the airport. But the cat later had to be euthanized because of injuries and malnutrition it suffered while lost. This weekend, Stewart enlisted the help of a local nonprofit, which provided a highly trained detection dog, to help track down Felix's scent. A wildlife biologist who works with the airport has also placed traps to facilitate Felix's safe return, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Officials at Kennedy have offered to assist Etihad Airways as the airline investigates what happened, the Port Authority said. Stewart said the couple will continue to search the airport until they have answers. "We just want to find Felix. But I just don't know if we will," she said.

Article: Convict: Small time drug dealer Rudy Guede, 29, is currently serving a 16-year sentence for the murder . The only person convicted for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher has declared that he will seek a retrial, following the sensational exoneration of Amanda Knox. Small time drug dealer Rudy Guede, 29, is serving a 16-year sentence for the murder in Perugia, Italy. The Ivory Coast national's DNA was found all over the bedroom where Miss Kercher was found half-naked, her throat slit in 2007, in the cottage she shared with Knox. Knox and ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito served four years for the murder, which prosecutors claimed was a sex game gone wrong, before being conclusively cleared last month by Italy's highest court. The Supreme Court's ruling throws a new lifeline to Guede, who was convicted by the same court of being an accomplice to a murder 'committed in the company of others'. Lawyers for Guede are likely to argue that the two sentences are incompatible, forcing a revision of his conviction. Speaking from prison in Viterbo, where he is described as 'a model prisoner' Guede claimed that his conviction is rendered 'impossible' by the exoneration of Knox and ex boyfriend Sollecito. He said: 'Look at me: I committed the impossible crime. How can I be the accomplice in a murder without any accomplices? ' Guede who is now halfway through his sentence said: 'I want a retrial.' He said his lawyers are waiting for the reasoning behind the innocent sentence of the Supreme Court, to be published which will be within 90 days of the Knox verdict. 'I am convinced that we will find elements to overturn the verdict,' he said. Cleared: Amanda Knox and her ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito served four years for Meredith Kercher's murder before being conclusively cleared by Italy's highest court last month . Tragic: Meredith Kercher was found half-naked with her throat slit in the cottage she shared with  Knox . Already the overturning of Knox and Sollecito's guilty sentences has left the Kercher family 'shocked' and with many unanswered questions. If Guede too were absolved, on a judicial technicality, it would leave no one paying for their daughter's murder. The Italian justice system is currently being overhauled because of its cost, contradictions and inefficiency. It has a backlog of around nine million legal cases. The Supreme Court, which hears 80,000 appeals a year, 100 times more than comparable countries, upholds only a fraction of convictions. The state were forced to pay €84million in compensation for miscarriages of justice and legal delays in 2011. Raffaele Sollecito (centre) speaks during a press conference in Rome flanked by his lawyers Giulia Bongiorno (left) and Luca Maori after being acquitted of murdering British student Meredith Kercher last month . Amanda Knox vowed to return to Italy just two days after being cleared of murdering British student Meredith Kercher. She is pictured (left) speaking after last month's decision and (right) after her initial acquittal in 2011 . Guede, who lives on a wing for violent sex offenders said that Knox and Sollecito had been 'fortunate'. But he told La Repubblica newspaper that the granting of their appeals had given him fresh hope. He said: 'Destiny has been less kind to me but I will not lament. Today I have a new reason to go on.' The 29-year-old, who came to Italy from Agou in Cote-d'Ivoire aged 7, has almost finished a degree in history from Rome Tre university. Once freed he wants to find a job in Italy and move forward. 'I want to prove to everyone that I am not a monster and forget my past. ' He said his only mistake was to opt for a fast track trial. He said: 'Here in Italy the fast track trial is seen as an admission of guilt. But I thought I would be able to prove my innocence straight away. ' Guede is eligible for day release this year.

Article: A sex offender who tried to evade justice by fleeing to Australia has been caught after police tracked him down through his boastful Facebook posts. Steven Allison, 37, formerly of Idle near Bradford, West Yorkshire, had been uploading pictures of himself looking tanned and happy as he enjoyed his freedom in his new life Down Under. But he was unaware the net was closing in as British police teamed up with colleagues in Australia and Interpol to locate Allison, who was living in the country's capital, Canberra. Steven Allison (left) was uploading pictures of himself in Australia to Facebook and writing posts about his former life in Yorkshire (right) despite being on the running from the law . Allison had already been on the run for a year when he was given a 30 month jail sentence for sexually assaulting two women after failing to turn up at Bradford Crown Court in February last year. He was supposed to be lying low in Sydney, where he found work as a labourer and handyman, but couldn't resist showing off his new life to his 739 Facebook friends. The sex attacker, who goes by 'Stig' on Facebook, posted pictures of his former life in Yorkshire and boasted about his carefree bachelor lifestyle, saying he wanted to meet women. Allison even joked about days being drunk in his hometown, including posts such as 'fooocking leathered that day,, for a change haha [sic]'. He also posted pictures of himself in his t-shirt on a building site with his arms raised in a mocking salute to Facebook friends, many of whom had no idea about his criminal past. The assaults happened in June 2013 when Allison had been out drinking with a friend in Yeadon, Leeds, where he approached two women who rejected his advances. Allison would not take no for an answer and indecently assaulted one of his victims as she left the pub in disgust. He had been laying low in Sydney (pictured) before moving to Canberra, where authorities closed in on him . When her friend threw a drink over him the rugby fan snapped and punched both girls to the ground. A West Yorkshire force spokesman said Allison had been charged with two sexual assaults but failed to appear in court. He added: 'Enquiries made by Bradford District's Public Protection Unit and Interpol traced him to Australia, where he had been working on construction sites. 'He was located in January this year and subsequently held in a detention centre, while arrangements were made for him to be returned to the UK.' While being held, Allison made one last bid for freedom by feigning an arm injury so he could attempt to escape while being taken for medical treatment. But his plan failed and he was brought back to the UK yesterday in handcuffs and flanked by three security guards from Australia. Det Insp Ben McDonald, of the Bradford District Safeguarding Unit, said: 'It was clear that Allison felt he could cheat justice by fleeing the country and escaping to Australia. 'He fled to the other side of the world to escape justice. However, the police will always pursue those wanted for serious crimes such as this, regardless of where they are in the world.' He is expected to appear in court before being transferred to prison.

Article: Three more political parties have vowed to teach lifesaving skills in schools, backing The Mail on Sunday’s campaign to add first aid to the curriculum. Charities last night welcomed the move to create a new generation of lifesavers, saying it could prevent hundreds of deaths every year. Previously, only the Liberal Democrats had promised to add the crucial lessons to the school curriculum. But last week Labour, Ukip and the Green Party added their support as they unveiled their Election manifestos. Three more political parties have backed The Mail on Sunday’s campaign to add first aid to the curriculum . It means the Conservatives are the only major party not to make the same manifesto pledge. Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham told The Mail on Sunday that the issue was ‘close to his heart’. He said: ‘One of my constituents, a very fit 16-year-old called Daniel Young, collapsed and died on the football pitch ten years ago. It really touched me – as a parent, the trauma of losing a child in those circumstances is incomprehensible. ‘Our manifesto pledge is about making sure all children are taught basic CPR skills before leaving school. We want to empower a generation of children, and potentially save hundreds of lives. This is about community resilience and people looking after each other.’ Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham (pictured left) said the issue was ‘close to his heart’ The Mail on Sunday is campaigning to make sure all schools teach basic first-aid techniques. The skills can also be taught by older children to their younger peers. The campaign has support from Schools Minister David Laws, teachers, doctors and leading charities. Tory Education Secretary Nicky Morgan believes schools should not be forced to teach first-aid skills as part of an overcrowded curriculum . However, Tory Education Secretary Nicky Morgan insists that while first-aid skills are important, schools should not be forced to teach them as part of an overcrowded curriculum. She will instead modernise sex education lessons to include advice on ‘revenge porn’ and internet safety. St John Ambulance has launched a ‘promise portal’ to encourage all Election candidates to register their support for the campaign. Richard Fernandez, the charity’s head of public affairs, said: ‘We have been calling for first aid to be a compulsory part of the national curriculum, so that every child has the chance to learn to be a lifesaver. 'This is a policy that has had backing from individuals in all parties, but it has yet to become reality. ‘We’re delighted that Labour, the Liberal Democrats, Ukip and the Greens have now adopted this policy and included it in their General Election manifestos. 'We are continuing to call on all candidates from the other parties to give their individual support.’ For more information, visit thepromise.sja.org.uk.

Article: A young mother has spoken of her humiliation after a dental assistant apparently removed her nine-month-old son from her arms without asking while she was breastfeeding him in the dentist's chair. Tayler Chaice Buzbee was forced to make an emergency appointment at an Aspen Dental facility in Alabama on Friday morning after developing agonizing toothache which would not go away. But after calling the dentist's office, she was informed that the only available appointment was in just 20 minutes - meaning that she had no time to find a babysitter for her infant son, Attley. Instead, Tayler was assured by employees that she could bring her baby to the facility. The pair turned up shortly after - but midway through the appointment, Attley started to create a fuss. Upset: Tayler Chaice Buzbee has spoken of her humiliation after a dental assistant apparently removed her baby son, Attley (pictured with Tayler) from her arms while she was breastfeeding him in the dentist's chair . 'I don't nurse in public, and I never have because I hear these stories about people being shamed... I don't do well with being confronted, so I usually find another room to go to,' Tayler toldAL.com. But she said that, in this instance, she had no option but to breastfeed Attley - a gorgeous dark-haired baby with big brown eyes and a cheeky grin - because he was hungry and causing a scene. The hygienists apparently did not mind Tayler nursing her son - and one even offered to halt the treatment and return when she was finished. But Tayler declined and continued to be treated. A short while later, the dentist and another female employee came into the room. The latter reportedly told Tayler that she was not permitted to breastfeed her baby in the dentist's office. Then, while the dentist examined Tayler's teeth, the employee removed Attley from her arms - without permission and before he had finished feeding from his mom - because he was 'in the way'. She then placed him in a stroller, it is reported. Tayler, who was shocked, left the office soon after.

She was left 'humiliated' after the breastfeeding incident . Speaking to the news site, the Marshalls employee said: 'I have never felt so humiliated in my life.' She added: 'That was my biggest concern. Don't take him out of my arms. It was a situation where I was humiliated, I was crying, and I felt just embarrassed to be there.' In a statement, Aspen Dental Management Inc apologized to Tayler. 'No nursing mother should ever be made to feel uncomfortable while feeding her child,' representative Kasey Pickett told AL.com. She added that the company is investigating the incident. It is not the first time a new mother has been 'shamed' for breastfeeding in public.

Last year, an international study found mothers are made to feel 'ashamed' when they breastfeed in public - while many are put off breastfeeding by negative comments from health workers. Mothers reported being stared at or tutted at and felt as if they were seen as 'hippies' or 'weirdos'. Others said they wanted to breastfeed after 12 months but feared public disapproval. Negative emotions are also common for new mothers who are trying to breastfeed in hospital soon after giving birth. These are due to staff actions and comments, the research found. Dr Gill Thomson, of the Maternal and Infant Nutrition and Nurture Unit at the University of Central Lancashire in Preston, led the study, which also involved researchers in Germany and Sweden.

Article: The last two 'Doolittle Tokyo Raiders' presented the group's Congressional Gold Medal for permanent display at the National Museum of the US Air Force on Saturday, 73 years to the day after their daring bombing attack on Japan rallied Americans in World War II. Retired Lt Col Richard 'Dick' Cole, age 99, gave the medal to the museum's director in a ceremony at the museum attended by military and political officials and relatives of the original 80 Raiders. The medal, awarded by Congress earlier in the week, arrived in a ceremonial B-25 flight. Scroll down for video . Staff Sgt David Thacker (left) and Lt Col Richard Cole (right) presented the Doolittle medal during a ceremony . The last Tokyo Doolittle Raiders gave the Congressional Gold Medal to the National Museum of the US Air Force . The important medal, which was awarded by Congress earlier in the week, arrived in a ceremonial B-25 flight . Cole, a Dayton native, was mission leader and James 'Jimmy' Doolittle's co-pilot for the B-25 bombers' attack that stunned Japan and lifted American spirits less than five months after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Last month, Lt Col Robert Hite (pictured), one of the three remaining Tokyo Doolittle Raiders, died after a battle with Alzheimer's disease at the age of 95 . Retired Staff Sgt David Thatcher, 93, came from Missoula, Montana, for the event, and said the medal was for all 80. Cole came from Comfort, Texas. Cole recalled wryly Saturday that on the evening of April 18, 1942, Thatcher was on the beach in China helping save his crew after a crash-landing, 'And I was hanging in my parachute in a tree.' Cole flew with Doolittle in plane No. 1 of the 16 launched from an aircraft carrier. Thatcher was engineer-gunner aboard the 7th plane, nicknamed 'The Ruptured Duck,' whose crew's crash-landing and evasion of Japanese troops in China was depicted in the movie Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo. Thatcher, who was played by Robert Walker in the movie while Spencer Tracy portrayed Doolittle, chuckled as he recounted how the Raiders had given little thought at the time of the raid about earning a place in history. 'We figured it was just another bombing mission,' he said in a recent phone interview from his home. In the years afterward, though, he said, they realized: 'It was an important event in World War II.' Cole said: 'We proudly hand over our Congressional Gold Medal to [museum director retired Lt Gen] Jack Hudson, who we trust will respectfully guard it and have it securely displayed... for the world to see and appreciate.' Their medal will join the museum's diorama about their raid. Hudson has pledged their inspirational story 'will live on.' The Doolittle Raid, also known as the Tokyo Raid, on April 18, 1942, caused negligible material damage to Japan . The raid by the US boosted American morale in the wake of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 . Three Raiders have died since their 70th anniversary reunion at the museum in Ohio, two of them this year. The latest to fall was Lt. Col. Robert Hite, who died March 29 at age 95 at a Nashville, Tennessee, nursing facility. Hite was also the last of the eight Raiders who were captured by Japanese soldiers. Three were executed and a fourth died in captivity. Three other Raiders were killed soon after the bombing run, as most crash-landed or had to bail out. Thatcher joined Cole and Lt. Col. Edward Saylor at the museum less than two years ago for a public 'Final Toast' in which they lifted specially engraved silver goblets for the traditional toast of their reunions to those who have gone. He and Cole planned to do so again this weekend at a private gathering, now saluting Hite and Saylor, who died in January at 94. The medal will join a diorama about the raid and museum director John Hudson (right) pledged the story will live . The Doolittle Raid, also known as the Tokyo Raid, on 18 April 1942, was an air raid by the United States during World War II. The raid, led by Lieutenant Colonel James 'Jimmy' Doolittle, caused negligible material damage to Japan, but helped to boost a wounded nation's morale in the aftermath of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. US Army Air Forces B-25B Mitchell medium bombers, with five crewmen on each were launched without fighter escort from an aircraft carrier in the Pacific. The 16 planes, loaded with one-ton bombs, took off from the aircraft carrier on less than 500 feet of runway. They had only enough fuel to drop their bombs on military targets in Japan and try to land in China with the hope that the Chinese would help them to safety. Pilots volunteered and trained in Florida for what they only knew was 'extremely hazardous.' Navigator Griffin, from Green Bay, Wisconsin, got top-secret briefings with pilot David Jones in Washington, just five months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Once at sea, the rest learned targets - factories, plants, military facilities on mainland Japan. They knew the uncertainties: what if the Navy task force was attacked? What defences would they face? And with B-25s unable to land on a carrier decks, could they reach friendly bases in China? Aircraft: The raid, led by Lieutenant Colonel James 'Jimmy' Doolittle, B-25B Mitchell medium bomber launched without fighter escort from an aircraft carrier in the Pacific . The Raiders brushed aside Doolittle's assurances that anyone was free to withdraw. After encountering Japanese patrols, the raid launched ahead of plan, some 200 miles farther from shore for fuel-stretched bombers. Doolittle's plane took off first at 08:20 from a pitching carrier deck. They flew low in radio silence, skimming seas and then treetops. Cole recalls the country song 'Wabash Cannonball' running through his head. He tapped his foot in time until Doolittle shot him a questioning look. They were greeted by anti-aircraft guns and puffs of black smoke. Flak shook planes. When they arrived at the target, Col. Doolittle ordered to open up the bomb bay doors. The bombs dropped, and the raiders 'got the heck out of there.' The danger was just beginning. All 16 planes lacked enough fuel to reach bases and either crash-landed or ditched in dark, rough weather along China's coast south of Shanghai. They narrowly stayed ahead of Japanese searchers, who killed villagers suspected of helping the Americans. Eight Raiders were captured, and three executed. A fourth died in captivity. Three had died off the coast of China. In the end, fourteen crews, except for one crewman, returned either to the United States or to American forces. Bird's eye view: The 16 planes, loaded with one-ton bombs, would fly over military targets in Japan and try to land in China with the hope that the Chinese would help them to safety .

Article: These stunning pictures show a trio of daredevil bikers dicing with death as they leap over huge jagged rocks metres above crashing waves. The mountain bike athletes were captured taking huge leaps as the sun went down over Portland Rock, an island off the coast of Weymouth, Dorset, on Sunday by photographer Jack Davies. The group included renowned professional trial bike riders Jack Gear, 25, Andrei Burton, 29, and Joe Seddon, 19, who were unfazed by the choppy waters just 10 metres below. Mr Davies said: 'It was incredibly dangerous, the sea was 10 metres below Andrei, crashing against jagged rocks, also the wind plays a big factor, threatening to blow them off course whilst in the air. 'It's a sport based around precision and getting your landing inch perfect. If the wind blows too hard it can completely alter your course in the air and throw you off the bike.' 'It was a really interesting day and so exhilarating to watch the riders launching themselves over the rocks.'

Article: Sirloin, topside and fillet are best saved for the roasting pan, chuck flank, rib-eye and skirt on the grill and when stewing go for brisket, shoulder and ribs. If you're roasting a joint this Sunday, remember that thyme and red wine make perfect partners and don't forget to scrape the roasting dish for juices to make a fresh delicious gravy. And when looking for a good cut of meat to grill or use for steak and fajitas, you want cuts that have a good marbling of fat. Research by Asda has found that rump, fillet and T-Bone are the most popular cuts of meat when eating out but when we cook at home the majority of us (55 per cent) rely on burgers or mince. The supermarket's study also showed a showing lack of beef knowledge in the under 35's, which was highlighted further by the extensive knowledge of their senior counterparts. One in four youngsters think pocket and Y-bone are cuts of beef, whereas only a mere 3 per cent of over 55s fell for the fake cuts. In addition, this age bracket correctly identified shin (78 per cent) and skirt (72 per cent) as cuts of beef widely available across the UK but for the younger folk, those figures more than halved. Over a quarter of under 35's avoid trying unusual cuts of beef because they assume it will be too expensive while 30 per cent admitted they had never been shown how to cook a cut of beef. A fifth of 18-34-year-olds also admitted they find larger cuts of beef daunting to cook. Although half of Brits in their 20s would happily choose rump steak on the menu at a restaurant, they lack the confidence or know-how to cook it at home and therefore rely on the staples of mince and burgers to feed their beefy cravings. Neil Moorcroft buying manager for beef at Asda said: 'It's probably fair to say our grandparent's generation are more likely to have been brought up on a varied diet of beef cuts depending on what was available from the local butcher. 'However busy lifestyles and a shift in family mealtimes has altered this over the years, which is why it's become easy to fall into the same old shopping and cooking routines. 'But it's never too late to experiment and beef up those cooking skills, so if you get stuck just ask for tips at your local butcher's counter'. 'Bigger cuts of meat can be daunting, but they have great versatility, value for money and are definitely worth getting to grips with.' Best for Roasting . Preparing a roast can be daunting, but the cuts below are always a safe bet for any Sunday roast. Sirloin . Topside . Top Rump . Fillet . Get your roast on: . 1. Allow it to reach room temperature before cooking. 2. On a medium to high hob heat, seal the beef joint in a large frying pan with a touch of oil ensuring all sides are sealed by turning the joint every two to three minutes. 3. Transfer to a oven roasting dish and seasoning with salt and pepper, place into a preheated oven (190c/fan 170c) and allow to cook for 20 minutes per 500g for a juicy medium cooked joint. 4. Remove meat from roasting tray and allow to rest on a plate in a warm area for 15-20 minutes before serving use the roasting dish and juices to make a fresh delicious gravy. 5. Thyme and red wine is a perfect partner for roast beef. Best for Grilling . When looking for a good cut of meat to grill or use for steak and fajitas, you want cuts which have a good marbling of fat and also a tender joint which doesn't need to be beaten or stewed in order to bring out the flavours. Go for: . Flank . Skirt . Sirloin . Ribeye bone-in . Become a grill master: . 1. If you've bought a cheaper cut such as flank or top blade then marinating these meats first (overnight if possible) will really help to tenderize them . 2. Use a red hot grill pan which sizzles when you add the steak and try not to push it around or turn it too quickly if you want to create those famous griddle marks . 3. Similarly to a roast, let the steaks rest for five minutes before eating to allow meat to relax and become more tender. Best for Stewing . These cuts of beef are often the most cost effective because they require that extra bit of love and care in the kitchen, but don't let the time put you off. The flavours are well worth the wait for a tasty bubbling stew. Brisket . Shoulder . Beef ribs . Shank . Stew your way to success: . 1. Low and slow is the key phrase here, so get yourself a heavy bottomed casserole pot or slow cooker, and plenty of stock to allow for a long slow cook . 2. Preparation is easy, any veg can simply been thrown in at the start and left to bubble away . 3. Four hours should result in tender chunks of beef ready to accompany sides such as mash, dumplings or Yorkshire puds .

Article: Arsene Wenger has yet to decide whether to offer Abou Diaby a new contract but has hinted that the injury-prone midfielder could have a future at Arsenal beyond this summer. Diaby made his latest comeback from injury in a practice game on Wednesday but has made just 22 appearances in the last five seasons at the Emirates Stadium with extended spells on the sidelines. Arsenal face Liverpool in Saturday's lunchtime kick-off and while Wenger is unlikely to throw Diaby straight into a vital game in both clubs' seasons, he did suggest the French midfielder could earn a new deal, potentially on a pay-as-you-play deal. Arsene Wenger has yet to decide whether to offer Abou Diaby a new contract despite his injury troubles . Diaby made his latest comeback from injury in a practice game on Wednesday and could have a future . Wenger said he has made it clear how he envisages the future for Diaby at the north London club . Diaby has featured just once this season, playing for 67 minutes in the Capital One Cup defeat by Southampton in September but could get his chance in the Barclays Premier League run-in. 'I had a chat with him (Diaby) and told him how I can envisage the future,' Wenger said. 'He has to make a decision. 'Of course he understands completely that he has to perform and to show that he can be present on a consistent way. I will see where we go from there. Diaby has suffered 42 injuries during his Arsenal career, keeping him out of action for a total of 226 weeks . Wenger also hopes to find a positive solution to tie Tomas Rosicky down to a contract extension at Arsenal . Club captain Mikel Arteta (right) has also been out with injury and is another to secure to a contract extension . 'I wouldn't like to go into details, we have to meet again to see where we go from what I told him. It has to be linked a little bit with his presence.'

Article: Mixed martial arts fighter Anderson Silva will meet with Brazilian taekwondo officials in the hope of competing in next year's Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, despite facing a possible doping ban. Silva this week expressed his desire to represent Brazil in the 2016 Games, and local taekwondo officials said they like the idea of having the MMA fighter on the team. The Brazilian taekwondo confederation said Wednesday that 'this wonderful possibility' of Silva competing in the Olympics will be discussed next week between the fighter and local officials. Anderson Silva (right) will meet with taekwondo officials in the hope of competing in next year's Olympics . The 40-year-old Silva began his career as a taekwondo fighter and is a black belt in the sport. He is an ambassador for taekwondo in Brazil. Silva, who is currently suspended by UFC after failing drug tests, said in a letter to the taekwondo confederation that it would be 'an immense pleasure' to be part of the Brazilian team in Rio. 'Everybody knows that every top athlete dreams about the Olympic Games,' Silva said. 'As an ambassador to the sport, and with the games taking place in my country, I'm even more motivated by the Olympic spirit.' Silva said he would compete with all his 'esteem, strength and honor.' On Wednesday, he posted on his official Twitter account a photo of himself practicing taekwondo. Silva tested positive for two steroids in an out-of-competition test Jan. 9, and also failed a test after his UFC victory over Nick Diaz on Jan. 31. The 40-year-old Brazilian posted a photo of himself practising taekwondo on Wednesday . The Brazilian later said in a statement that he always 'played clean' and 'never used any substances' to improve his performances, and that he was 'still waiting for the results and analysis from the specialists that are working to reveal the truth.' Silva has a hearing scheduled for May on the doping allegations. Silva is considered one of the best pound-for-pound mixed martial arts fighters in the history of the sport, . The former middleweight champion returned to the cage in January after breaking his lower left leg more than a year ago. He beat Diaz but the victory was quickly overshadowed by the doping headlines that surfaced shortly after the fight. Silva delivers a flying knee against Nick Diaz in their middleweight bout in Las Vegas in January . According to the Brazilian taekwondo confederation, its president Carlos Fernandes was 'pleased' to receive Silva's proposal, but many details still must be discussed before his participation in the games can become a reality. There are doubts about Silva's eligibility for the games, as well as about his form, considering he hasn't competed in taekwondo events in a long time. 'He is a great MMA athlete, but taekwondo has its own characteristics, so I'm sure he is not ready yet to compete for a spot in the team,' Lucas Ferreira, one of the other Brazilian taekwondo fighters hoping to participate in the Olympics, told Globoesporte.com. 'He will have to fight for a spot like everybody else. If he proves he deserves to make it, then great.' Another Brazilian fighter, Guilherme Felix, said it wouldn't be ethical for Silva to earn a spot in the Olympics 'without showing the results for it.'

Article: Real Madrid's last win against Atletico Madrid came in the Champions League final less than a year ago, but in the time since that memorable night in Lisbon Carlo Ancelotti's side have failed to win any of their last seven games against their city rivals. Wednesday night's Champions League quarter-final second leg will be the eighth time the two teams have met since last season's final, with Diego Simeone's men emerging victorious on four occasions over the previous eight months. Real needed a late equaliser from Sergio Ramos and extra-time to beat Atleti at Benfica's Estadio da Luz in May last year but Los Rojiblancos have gained a measure of revenge since. Cristiano Ronaldo couldn't find the back of the net as Real Madrid drew 0-0 with Atletico Madrid last week . Gareth Bale scores in extra-time during Real's Champions League final win against Atletico last season . Real Madrid have not beaten rivals Atletico since victory in Lisbon, losing four games and drawing three . Real Madrid wins - 0 . Atletico Madrid wins - 4 . Draws - 3 . Real Madrid goals - 4 . Atletico Madrid goals - 12 . Atletico's dominance began with victory in the Spanish Super Cup, a two-legged tie played between the winners of La Liga and the Copa del Rey. A late equaliser from Raul Garcia cancelled out James Rodriguez's opener at the Bernabeu before Mario Manduzkic netted the only goal of the game at the Vicente Calderon to seal a 2-1 win on aggregate. Less than a month later and Simeone's men were at it again, this time defeating Los Blancos in their own backyard in La Liga. A penalty from Cristiano Ronaldo got the hosts level after Tiago's early header but Arda Turan popped up in the 76th minute to sweep the ball past Iker Casillas and secure a 2-1 triumph. Atletico's third win against Real this season arrived in January when the two sides met in the last 16 of the Copa del Rey. With the first leg on home soil, Fernando Torres made a winning return to his boyhood club as he helped the hosts earn a 2-0 win courtesy of goals from Garcia and Jose Maria Gimenez.

Fernando Torres scores his second goal during Atletico's 2-2 draw with Real Madrid in the Copa del Rey . Atleti finished the job at the Bernabeu with goals in the first minute of each half from Torres helping them to a 2-2 draw on the night and 4-2 victory on aggregate. Real's most humiliating result in their seven-game winless streak arrived at the Vicente Calderon on February 7 as Gareth Bale and Co suffered their heaviest defeat in over four years. Goals from Tiago, Saul Niguez, Antoine Griezmann and Mandzukic earned the reigning champions a 4-0 win to maintain their hopes of a second consecutive title. The two sides played out a goalless draw in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final last week, with Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak widely praised for denying Real a crucial away goal.

Article: (Billboard)The key to rock's longevity is it never defines itself into irrelevance. So while there were some loud, dirty guitars at the 2015 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in Cleveland on Saturday night, there was as much recognition for rock's antecedents in soul and blues, speaking less to a particular taxonomy than a spirit that's beyond words. It's easy to talk of such spirit when Paul McCartney is there to honor Ringo Starr, and Yoko Ono is on hand as well. Speaking briefly backstage, Ono expressed feeling that it was wonderful for Starr to be honored, "just sad John and George aren't here," referring to her late husband John Lennon and Beatles guitarist and fellow songwriter George Harrison. Starr was certainly happy to be there — after a long wait, he's the final Beatle to be inducted as a solo act. "I've finally been invited, and I love it," said the 74-year-old drummer. "I got lucky, and it was actually in Cleveland," he said to enormous applause. Fifty-one years earlier, Starr had been in town to play the very same Hall; he admitted backstage that he didn't remember the cops stopping the show during "All My Loving" and making the Beatles return to the dressing room for ten minutes until the fans could be calmed. Starr said in a backstage interview that he couldn't recall the incident specifically, but admitted that there had been a lot of shows in between. "I'll remember this one," he promised. Others receiving Rock Hall honors included Paul Butterfield Blues Band, early soul act The 5 Royales, singer Bill Withers, punk rockers Green Day, Lou Reed, Joan Jett & the Blackhearts and Stevie Ray Vaughan. It was a night for the young to honor the old and perhaps prepare for a later visit. John Mayer hailed his longtime idol, the late Vaughan, in a heartfelt speech. John Legend came out to honor Bill Withers with a performance of "Use Me" backed by Stevie Wonder, who inducted Withers. The two then shared "Lean on Me," until Legend went and pulled Withers to the front of the stage to join them. Beck, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Bill Withers, Seymour Stein hit Rock Hall's weekend festivities . The 76-year old soul legend hasn't performed live in many years but had hinted in the months leading up to the induction ceremonies that he might sing once more. Withers sounded great, though he may have an even brighter future in stand-up. "This has got to be the biggest AA meeting [in the] Western hemisphere," said Withers, alluding to an earlier moment in the show when Jimmie Vaughan confessed, "I taught my brother guitar, and he taught me how to get sober." He called being inducted by Wonder, "A lion holding the door for a kitty cat." The moment of relative levity was welcome after moving tributes paid to the late Lou Reed by Patti Smith and Reed's widow, music artist Laurie Anderson, who shared the three rules for life that they came up with: "One: don't be afraid of anyone; Two: get a really good b------t detector and learn how to use it; Three: be really, really tender." Smith had to push back tears on at least three occasions. She recalled a night when they wound up in the same hotel and Reed invited her up. She found him in the tub dressed in black and she sat on the toilet and talked with him. Green Day was inducted by Fall Out Boy, who referenced the length of some of the speeches. Cracked Fall Out Boy frontman Patrick Stump: "I feel like I'm in a line at the DMV." As one of the youngest acts, it's not surprising they gave one of the two most exciting performances of the evening. Rock Hall induction ceremony: Lou Reed 'would be amused,' says sister . The other belonged to Tom Morello, Doyle Bramhall II and Zac Brown with harmonica player Jason Ricci performing "Born in Chicago" in tribute to the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. Not only did Ricci slay, but Morello played a nasty scabrous solo that raised the hairs on your arm, it was so alive. Miley Cyrus inducted Joan Jett in her own inimitable way, recalling a time she walked in on Jett smoking pot and being so turned on by her strength, wisdom and soul that the young pop star wanted to have sex with the legendary rocker. Jett joined the Blackhearts and Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl for a mini-set that include such classics as "Bad Reputation," the Runaways' "Cherry Bomb" and "Crimson and Clover," the Tommy James & the Shondelles cover that Jett took to No. 1. It was that kind of a night, and it closed with a rousing version of the Beatles' "I Want to Be Your Man," where just about everybody who could make it out on stage did, including a near-end guitar scrum/lead-off between Gary Clark Jr., Morello, Zac Brown and Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Nick Zinner. ©2015 Billboard.

Article: A woman has spoken of her regrets about going under the knife after a Turkish surgeon botched her facelift and left her with her ears sewn awkwardly to the side of her face. Belinda, 56, from Essex, had hoped the operation would deal with her jowls and says she was looking 'worn out' ahead of the procedure. But the 'horrendous' scars produced by the bungling surgeon have left her bereft of confidence and feeling worse than ever before. Scroll down for video . Belinda, 56, from Essex, admits she wishes she'd never had a facelift because of the 'horrendous' scars it left her around her ears - the result of a botched procedure she underwent in Turkey (pictured) Budget job: Belinda, who appears on tonight's episode of TLC's Extreme Beauty Disasters (pictured), travelled to Turkey to have the facelift because it was cheaper . Now Belinda is to appear on TLC's Extreme Beauty Disasters to warn of the dangers of travelling abroad for cut-price surgery - and to see if anything can be done about her botched facelift. Plastic surgeon consultant Vik Vijh commented: 'Her scars are really very poor. They're stretched and they are dragging down her earlobes.' Belinda's problems began when she noticed she was looking more tired than usual and set about finding a cosmetic solution. In the UK, the average facelift costs £7,900, so Belinda was thrilled when she found a Turkish surgeon offering cut-price operations that cost a fraction of the UK equivalent. Having already had successful cosmetic procedures in the past, among them breast implants and a tummy tuck, she says she felt positive about the prospect of facelift. Her husband agreed at the time, hoping it might 'freshen her up', but says, with hindsight, that 'it was one of the worst ideas I've ever had in my life.' Expert opinion: 'Her scars are really very poor,' admits plastic surgeon consultant Vik Vijh, who set out to correct the damage by re-doing her facelift. 'They're stretched and they are dragging down her earlobes' Mr Vijh (left) recommends another full face and neck lift to correct the damage, but warns Belinda (right) she could be risking nerve damage and further scarring . An excited Belinda then travelled to Turkey for the procedure, where such 'bargains' are common, checked into an Istanbul clinic and went under the knife. Initially thrilled with her 'fresh, plumped-out skin', doubts began to set in during the healing process. Expecting a dramatic change, the healed facelift, says Belinda, 'hadn't done anything' - except, much to her horror, leave her with earlobes that had been 'sewn' to the sides of her face. According to Mr Vijh, this was due to the surgeon stitching up Belinda's face in the wrong position, resulting in bad scarring that should have been concealed behind her ears, not around them . Still, Belinda is determined to go ahead, and after a gruelling session on the operating table at the hands of Mr Vijh (pictured), she comes out smiling . 'We've lifted her neck, we've pulled up her face, and got rid of all those scars,' Mr Vijh states. Pictured, Belinda's ear before (left) and after (right) the corrective surgery . As a result, another full face and neck lift was required, as well as extra surgery to hide the scarring. Belinda, who had been left miserable by her experience, says the new face lift has restored her confidence and left her happier. 'Finally I am happy,' she says. 'My scars have drastically reduced and now I can stop worrying about going out, or  about people looking at me from the side.' Extreme Beauty Disasters starts next Tuesday at 8pm on TLC . No more hiding: Belinda, pictured before (left) and after (right), makes a reappearance on the show once she has healed and looks refreshed and happy with her new and improved appearance . 'Finally I am happy,' says Belinda, pictured with her husband. 'My scars have drastically reduced and now I can stop worrying about going out, or  about people looking at me from the side'

Article: Blue Bell Ice Cream announced Friday that it has suspended operations at an Oklahoma production facility that officials had previously connected to a foodborne illness linked to the deaths of three people. 'We are taking this step out of an abundance of caution to ensure that we are doing everything possible to provide our consumers with safe products and to preserve the trust we have built with them and their families for more than a century,' the company said in a statement. Last month, the company and health officials said a 3-ounce cup of ice cream contaminated with listeriosis was traced to a plant in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. Scroll down for video . Blue Bell Ice Cream has suspended operations at an Oklahoma production facility that officials had previously connected to a foodborne illness linked to the deaths of three people . Ten products recalled earlier in March were from a production line at a plant the company's headquarters in Brenham, Texas . The now-recalled ice cream product - cups of chocolate, strawberry and vanilla - is not sold in retail locations and is shipped in bulk to 'institutional accounts' such as hospitals in 23 states that comprise less than 5 per cent of the company's sales. 'We recommend that consumers do not eat any Blue Bell brand products made at the company's Oklahoma facility and that retailers and institutions do not sell or serve them,' the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said late Friday. Ten products recalled earlier in March were from a production line at a plant in Brenham, Texas, the company's headquarters. The recall, the first in the company's 108-year history, began when five patients at Via Christi St. Francis hospital in Wichita, Kansas, became ill with listeriosis while hospitalized at some point from December 2013 to January 2015. Officials determined at least four drank milkshakes that contained Blue Bell ice cream. Three of the patients later died. Listeriosis, also known as listeria, is a life-threatening infection caused by eating food contaminated with bacteria called Listeria monocytogenes, according to the CDC. Listeriosis, also known as listeria, is a life-threatening infection caused by eating food contaminated with bacteria called Listeria monocytogenes . The disease primarily affects pregnant women, newborns, older adults and people with weakened immune systems. The CDC also said Friday that it has identified six patients with listeriosis between 2010 and 2014 that was indistinguishable from that found in the 3-ounce cup ice cream product traced to the Oklahoma plant. Four of the six patients were hospitalized in Texas for unrelated problems before developing listeriosis, according to the CDC. The one patient for whom information is available reported eating ice cream in a Texas hospital before developing listeriosis and the Texas Department of State Health Services reported the hospital had received Blue Bell brand ice cream cups, the CDC said. The 'investigation to determine whether these illnesses are related to exposure to Blue Bell products is ongoing,' the CDC said. Blue Bell said it will conduct a 'careful and complete examination' of its Oklahoma plant 'to determine the exact cause of the contamination.' The company says it voluntarily shut down the plant, then notified the U.S. Food and Drug Administration . 'Once our investigation is complete and we have made all necessary improvements, it will return to operation,' according to the company's statement. 'Our other plants continue to operate and supply our products to retail stores and institutional customers.' The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has been notified of the company's decision to voluntarily shut down the plant, Blue Bell said. In addition to the Broken Arrow plant, the company has two plants in Brenham and one in Sylacauga, Alabama. The recalled ice cream had been shipped to Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Wyoming.

Article: A 21-year-old man has been charged with second-degree murder after allegedly shooting dead his fiancée at their Minnesota home on  Easter morning while holding their baby daughter in his arms. Dimitri Harrell reportedly pulled out his gun and pointed it at 19-year-old Samirria White after they started arguing over his 'infidelity' in the bedroom of their St Paul apartment at around 3.40am. Carrying the couple's three-month-old child, he then shot Miss White in the face at close range, according to police. When medics arrived at the scene, they pronounced the young mother dead. Now, Harrell, who later admitted to having stored his handgun under his daughter's mattress, has been charged with one count of second-degree murder at Ramsey County District Court. Shooting: Dimitri Harrell (right) has been arrested after allegedly shooting dead his fiancée, Samirria White (left), at their Minnesota home on Easter morning while holding their baby daughter (center) in his arms . The suspect, who had  'trust issues' with Miss White after having two children by another woman, remains in custody in lieu of $200,000 bail. If convicted, he faces up to 40 years in prison. In the moments before Sunday's shooting, Harris had been arguing with Miss White after he had vanished from the apartment several times during the night, arousing her suspicions, relatives said. During an interview with police, the suspect apparently told officers he had then tried to pull his gun - which he had bought several days earlier - from his pocket while holding the couple's baby daughter. However, the weapon had accidentally discharged, he said, causing a bullet to strike Miss White in the face, according to the Star Tribune. It is unclear whether he explained why he took out the gun. Tragic: Harrell reportedly pulled out his gun and fired at 19-year-old Miss White (pictured with their daughter) after they started arguing over his 'infidelity' in the bedroom of their St Paul apartment at around 3.40am . Arrest: Now, Harrell has been charged with one count of second-degree murder at Ramsey County District Court. Above, the suspect is pictured in his mug shot (left) and posing with Miss White and their baby (right) Several people - including some of the victim's siblings - were also in the property at the time of the alleged murder. Many of them heard yelling come from the couple's bedroom, CBS reported. Miss White's 16-year-old brother, who woke up after apparently hearing his sister scream 'Don't point that gun at me!',  ran into the room when he heard the gunshot. There, he found his sister dead . The boy yelled at Harrell to get away from Miss White, according to a complaint obtained by the Tribune. In response, the suspect apparently told him it was an accident and fled the scene. After emergency crews arrived at the scene, Miss White was declared dead and the bedroom was cordoned off. Police later found the gun on Harrell's 'close friend', who was in the apartment. Scene: The shooting occurred in the 800 block of Pierce Butler Route (pictured) in Minnesota on Sunday . Family: In the moments before Sunday's shooting, Harris had been arguing with Miss White after he had vanished from the apartment several times during the night, arousing her suspicions, relatives said . The man, who has not been identified by officials, had reportedly received the weapon from Harrell just minutes after the shooting. The suspect had apparently told him: 'Do something with this'. Harrell, who is pictured with Miss White and their daughter in numerous Facebook photos,  told police that their relationship had been rocky since the births of his  two children by a different woman. On Tuesday, relatives described Miss White, a former Humboldt Senior High School student, as a 'spontaneous' and loving woman who had hoped to become a nurse and adored her daughter. On her Facebook page, Miss White lists the date she got engaged as March 23, 2012. She also reveals that she was born in Elgin, Illinois. Her three-month-old daughter's name is unknown.. Pregnancy: On Tuesday, relatives described Miss White (left, pregnant with Harrell and right, in another pregnancy shot) as a 'spontaneous' woman who had hoped to become a nurse and adored her daughter .

Article: He's been mocked for his inability to eat a bacon sandwich properly and likened to cartoon character Wallace - but that didn't prevent Ed Miliband from coming top in the sex appeal stakes during last night's debate. Moments after the Labour leader finished speaking, fans took to Twitter to coo adoringly about his 'sexy grey tie' and his smouldering looks. One rather breathless Tweet read: 'Miliband is totally talking to me and no one else, you sexy beast. Keep staring down the camera Ed! #leadersdebate' Scroll down for video . So hot right now: Ed Miliband's looks proved a hit with Twitter users during last night's debate . Another, Holly Ashby, asked why no one had asked Mr Miliband a question about his hair, complaining: . 'Why has no one asked about Ed Miliband's sexy Rogue-From-X-Men grey streak? It's all I care about tbh.' One fan even likened Miliband to Hansel, a character from modelling comedy Zoolander, tweeting: . 'Ed seducing the ladies with his patter. He's so hot right now, just like Hansel #leadersdebate #zoolander' Another, named Chloeee, added: 'Ed Miliband really is hot.' Shortly afterwards, a Vine of Mr Miliband smouldering sultrily into the camera took the internet by storm, while popular website Buzzfeed took note of the phenomenon and published a piece rounding up the best romantic Tweets. But Mr Miliband, 45, who spent the day after the debate in Blackpool with his family, isn't the first politician to find himself on the receiving end of attention based on his good looks. Family day out: Mr Miliband has spent the day enjoying fish and chips with his family in Blackpool . On the campaign trail: Mr Miliband was canvassing for votes and drafted in his wife and sons to help out . Making his point: It wasn't just Mr Miliband's looks that got viewers talking . Impressed: A viewer finds herself enjoying the sight of Mr Miliband's saturnine looks . Enjoying it: Two watching women compare their notes on the Labour leader . Favourite bit: One Twitter user declared her love for Mr Miliband's 'Rogue-From-X-Men' grey streak . Handsome: Another Twitter user was surprised to find herself fancying the Labour leader . Last October, Swedish health minister Gabriel Wikström, 30, found himself bombarded by risqué messages from adoring Turkish fans after making a visit to the country. Nicknamed 'the handsome minister' by his growing legion of fans, Wikström, a Social Democrat who holds the position of Public Health Minister, said at the time that he was 'honoured' by all the attention. Speaking to English language Swedish daily newspaper, The Local, he said: 'I can’t feel anything but honoured and glad. And a little bit surprised, I must admit.' Denmark's prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, 48, is another politician famous for her glamorous looks, while her 39-year-old agriculture minister, Dan Jørgensen, has also proved a hit with the ladies. Impressed: Viewers appeared to appreciate Mr Miliband's 'sexy tie' and the grey streak in his hair . Seductive: Another compared Mr Miliband to Hansel from Zoolander, adding: 'He's so hot right now' Was it deliberate? One Twitter user appeared less convinced by Mr Miliband's smoulder . Swoon: A Twitter user describes Mr Miliband as a 'sexy beast' and exhorts him to keep looking at the camera . Sexy MP: Swedish health minister Gabriel Wikström has proved a big hit with the ladies . Arguably the most popular of all though, other than Wikström himself, is 36-year-old Hans Linde of Sweden's Left Party, who is as famous for his handsome face as he is for his politics. And while Denmark and Sweden have plenty of good-looking ministers to choose from, the UK has several of its own. Although Sexy MP, a website dedicated to Parliament's great and good-looking, has now shut down, it regularly put Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith, 40, at the top of its looks list while running. MPs snapping at Mr Goldsmith's heels include Labour's shadow education and business secretaries, Tristram Hunt, 40, and Chuka Umunna, 36, . Other politicians to set pulses racing, both past and present, include Barack Obama, French prime minister Manuel Valls and Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto. And now, of course, Ed Miliband as well. Smouldering: Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto has won plaudits for his saturnine good looks . Hot stuff: Labour's Chuka Umunna and Tristram Hunt are almost as swooned over as their party leader . Conservative crumpet: Zac Goldsmith is considered one of the UK's best looking parliamentarians . Latin lover: French prime minister Manuel Valls is as famous for his looks as he is for his policies .

Article: Lovingly tended gardens with their manicured lawns and neat flowerbeds were once the very essence of Englishness. But these days we are increasingly using outdoor space for the occasional barbecue or to relax in a hot tub rather than for tending flowers, according to researchers. As a result, only a handful of traditional flowers still grow in English country gardens, with the average one usually containing a mere four species – daffodils, crocuses, roses and tulips. These days we are increasingly using outdoor space for the occasional barbecue or to relax in a hot tub rather than for tending flowers, according to researchers (file image) Almost 40 per cent of people, including 66 per cent of those aged 18-29, spend more time sunbathing and having barbecues in their garden than tending it, according to the survey of 1,000 adults by the garden furniture retailer Alfresia.co.uk. Sir Roy Strong, the landscape designer and former director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, told the Sunday Times: ‘British people used to take pride in having neat gardens with lots of flowers. ‘Now they are watching lots of gardening shows on television but doing less gardening themselves.’ Typical of the trend is Chris Penn, a 31-year-old council officer from Newport, Gwent, who said: ‘The main purpose of our garden is as a space to unwind with a glass of wine on a warm evening after work.’ As a result, only a handful of traditional flowers still grow in English country gardens, with the average one usually containing a mere four species – daffodils, crocuses, roses and tulips (file image) It comes after another recent study found that more and more people are digging up their flower beds to make way for hot tubs and outdoor spas. Despite the unpredictable climate, one in ten households has a hot tub in the garden – and the British and Irish Spa and Hot Tub Association has said sales actually increase in years of cold weather. A survey of 2,000 homeowners carried out for Lloyds TSB Insurance found that 10 per cent of respondents owned a hot tub, with the equipment in the average UK garden now worth £1,928. And around 57 per cent of householders surveyed by Lloyds TSB said they use the garden as a place to relax, rather than to cultivate plants.

Article: Looking after someone with dementia can stretch people to their limits, and there are many in this situation. In England alone, there are more than 670,000 unpaid carers helping someone with dementia. Here, in the final week of our major Good Health series on dementia, we turn our attention to the carers and what can be done to make life easier for them and their loved ones... Scroll down for video . Looking after someone with dementia can stretch people to their limits. Here's how to make life easier . WHAT TO EXPECT . The early stages of the disease bring changes that may be so subtle that some friends and acquaintances are unaware that there is anything wrong - and this stage can continue for many years. But as the disease progresses and more damage is done to the brain, symptoms become more pronounced: difficulties with communication become more intense and issues such as getting dressed or managing day-to-day affairs become more problematic. This marks the beginning of the middle stage, the longest stage, which can last for several years. It's when the condition becomes more challenging and extra help may be needed. However, there will be good days as well as bad. The following can help . . . ESTABLISH ROUTINES . In the early stages of dementia, it's the short-term memory that's most affected, making it harder for patients to keep track of the day, or even what time of day it is. I've found that sticking to a routine helps keep someone with dementia better orientated, and gets their body clock into a rhythm. In the early stages, aim to establish fixed times of day for the following - it may help to write this on a board that's kept next to a calendar (cross it off to show what day it is) and a clock, so that they know what to expect when. In the middle stages of dementia, routines may still be useful but patients can be more prone to mood changes, so be flexible. Encourage but don't coerce. Often people with dementia may display more symptoms and anxiety as the light starts to fade . WHEN BEHAVIOUR CHANGES . The middle stage of dementia inevitably heralds changes in behaviour. This can be one of the toughest things to cope with, for at times it may seem as if the person you know and love has gone. The following are common: . Clinginess . This can be very draining as some people with dementia do not like to let their carer out of their sight. Clinginess is the return of a psychological reflex from our toddler years - a toddler will cry when their mother moves away or when a stranger approaches. As the dementia progresses, the loss of nerve cells in the brain allows old reflexes that were replaced in adulthood by more complex brain pathways to resurface. What to do: The best way to deal with it is by diluting contact - try introducing other regular carers as soon as the person being cared for starts to display any clingy behaviour. The clinging behaviour may now apply to many people, not just one. Wandering . Around 60 per cent of those with dementia wander - pacing around the house or outside of the home - and the problem is they can get lost, as the damage to the hippocampus part of the brain means they lose their sense of orientation. What to do: If they tell you they're going out don't argue but speak calmly and tell them they don't need to as they are 'staying here' tonight. Avoid busy places such as shopping centres. People with dementia may find these disorientating and when they get home this disorientation can continue and induce wandering so they may feel the urge to leave the house. Wandering about the house at night can arise from a need to go to the loo. Ensure they don't have too much fluid before bed and install night-lights to help prevent falls. Painting the walls and doors a matching colour makes it less likely that the person with dementia will find their way out. You could also consider moving the lock higher up the door to a less familiar place. You may want to consider installing movement sensors to alert you to potential problems. Anxiety . Worrying for no reason or displaying physical symptoms such as palpitations are signs that the dementia patient may be suffering with anxiety. What to do: Try to identify what's causing it - have there been more people round than normal, or have they had too much caffeine? Many of the triggers may be unavoidable, but it can help to keep their surroundings as comfortable and relaxing as possible. Put pictures and familiar possessions around them. Pleasant smells such as flowers, baking aromas and soap may trigger memories that help distract them from their anxious feelings. Playing music can also be calming. Talking to them can distract them, too. But never talk down to them or use childish language as this could make them angry. Anger and aggression . It can be confusing when someone who was once so patient and tolerant becomes prone to temper tantrums. What to do: It's important to consider any physical reasons that might be making them this way. Pain is a common cause of anger in those with dementia, as are urinary or chest infections, a stroke, or even something as simple as not having had enough sleep. If you suspect any of these is possible, then speak to a doctor. Speak to the person with dementia reassuringly, in a calm manner. Use music or a calming activity such as massaging or stroking their hand or brushing their hair to distract them. If, however, they seem aggressive do not put yourself in danger. If necessary, move back and wait for them to calm down. Keep the person busy at sundown and in the early evening . Sundowning . Often people with dementia have good and bad days but also good and bad times during a given day - and often they may display more symptoms and anxiety as the light starts to fade, becoming confused, agitated, restless or showing repetitive behaviours. This pattern is referred to as 'sundowning'. It's not clear why this happens - it's possible it's to do with a disruption to brain chemicals affecting the body clock. Two-thirds of those with Alzheimer's disease experience sundowning. It can occur at any stage of the condition, but tends to peak at the middle stage and lessen as the disease progresses. What to do: Keep the person busy at sundown and in the early evening. Avoid stimulants such as coffee or alcohol at this time of day as this may make them more excitable. A rocking chair can help as it is soothing and relaxing. It may also help to introduce more light into the room. LOOK THEM IN THE EYE WHEN YOU TALK . With dementia, the parts of the brain that normally deal with understanding, thought processing and language deteriorate. The patient may struggle with nuances and may lose their sense of humour; they may also get frustrated and cross when they can't quickly bring to mind the words they need. Furthermore, they may seem to get stuck in a loop and repeat the same question again and again. The following strategies can help tackle these issues: . Better to say: 'You seem to have put the crockery in the washing machine. Did you mean to put them in the dishwasher?' ■ Dr Souter is a retired GP and fellow of the Royal College of General Practitioners.

Article: With luxury plane suites pushing the boundaries of lavish travel, the upstairs-downstairs-style divide between economy and suites is continually growing. And now Airbus is set to introduce an extra seat to each row of its Airbus A380 model, squeezing yet more passengers onto each plane. From 2017 there will be 11 seats incorporated into the same space as the current 10 are placed, and  a fourth class introduced in response to the new dreaded middle seat. Scroll down for video . Tight squeeze! Airbus are set to cram an extra seat into their Airbus 380 in the middle section. The change is due to come into place in 2017 . The configuration was rejected by Emirates but two manufacturers, Zodiac and Geven, have agreed to deliver the seats . The addition of the centre seat will change the current configuration from 3-4-3 to become a 3-5-3 set up. At the moment the company uses First, Business and Economy class, but there will soon be the addition of 'budget economy', cleverly branded as Choice Economy. Some critics have gone as far as calling the new set-up 'economy minus'. Senior Vice President of Marketing for Airbus Christopher Emerson, told trade publication Leeham News and Comment: 'Ninety per cent of world travellers are economy but not all are homogeneous. 'We want to give a choice to the 90 per cent of the economy passengers. They are going to be the driver of the growth, the doubling of growth in the next 15 years.' Miraculously the inclusion of an additional seat will not alter the seat width for economy ticket holders. Currently the width is 18in, which falls in line with the aircraft manufacturer's manifesto 18 months ago to adopt that size as an industry standard. Airbus claims a rearrange of the cabin has enabled it to maintain this width and squeeze in the extra seat. The width of the arm rest, however, will change, with the aircraft adopting a slimmer version. The launch was announced in Hamburg this week, despite customer Emirates Airlines confirming it would not pursue the new arrangement for its aircraft - reportedly over fears the new design could affect its reputation for quality economy seating, according to trade publication Aviation Week. Airbus Vice President-Cabin Innovation and Design Ingo Wuggetzer said at the Aircraft Interiors Expo that more innovation should be going into economy cabins. 'In the past most innovation went into premium products, but that is only for six per cent of the travellers,' he said. The Airbus A380 will be advertised as having 544 seats instead of 525, and Emerson said the additional revenue per aircraft would be $20m per year. 'That's the equivalent of 40 per cent fuel burn reduction,' he explained. How the other half live! Rich fliers can enjoy private three-room suite for a luxurious first-class experience . Luxury surroundings: The Airbus 380 cabin is one of the quietest and most spacious in the sky .

Article: A rescued baby orangutan whose heartbreaking plight captured the hearts of thousands, has gone on to find love. Budi - who spent the first year of his life trapped in a chicken coup - was introduced to Jemmi less than a month ago and now the two apes appear to be inseparable. Indeed, video footage captured at the International Animal Rescue's orangutan center in Indonesia, shows the duo throwing adoring glances at each other as they share a dinner of fruit. At one point Jemmi nuzzles Budi's side and purses her lips, as if she is blowing him a kiss. He then promptly performs the same gesture back at her. Love at first sight: Budi - who spent the first year of his life trapped in a chicken coup - was introduced to Jemmi less than a month ago and now the two apes appear to be inseparable. Two peas in a pod: Indeed, video footage captured at the International Animal Rescue's Orangutan Rescue Centre in Indonesia, shows the duo throwing adoring glances at each other as they share a dinner of fruit . Mimicking: At one point Jemmi nuzzles Budi's side and purses her lips, as if she is blowing him a kiss - he then promptly performs the same gesture back at her . Carers at the rescue center say that 15-month-old Budi and Jemmi have developed a 'beautiful friendship'. Along with eating meals together, they apparently enjoy playing around on the ropes and branches of their enclosure. A spokesperson added: 'If Budi is taken into the day enclosure first he will keep looking back for Jemmi and, if left on his own, will cry until his new friend joins him. 'At the end of the day they both make their way back to their shared hammock where they spend the night together.' Budi was dying from malnutrition and too weak to move when the International Animal Rescue discovered him in Borneo, Indonesia, last December. Rescued: Budi also had a tough start to life Budi the orangutan and was found (pictured) lying on his back in a wire chicken coop without the strength to sit up . Tragedy: This photo, taken at the time of his rescue, shows the 10-month-old with a thin blanket in his cage for comfort . Along with being kept in a confined space, his owner had never given him a single mouthful of solid food for fear it would be bad for him - leaving his tiny limbs swollen and bent. Earlier footage showed him crying in pain when one of his carers gently turned his body or lifted him to sit up. But thanks to intensive treatment and care from International Animal Rescue's veterinary team, he made a remarkable recovery. Meanwhile, eight-month-old Jemmi was orphaned when her mother was killed and then illegally sold as a pet. Despite their rough beginnings, the wonderful new footage shows the orangutans' transformation from frail and helpless babies into inquisitive animals, now strong enough to swing from trees. They look extremely comfortable in each other's company as they sit side-by-side. It's hoped that their friendship gets them both used to being around other orangutans so they can hopefully be released into the wild some day. Strength: The tiny orangutan didn't have the muscle strength to open his mouth when he was first rescued from a life of neglect . One of many: International Animal Rescue are keen to stress that Budi's story is not an isolate case and there are 'countless' orangutans currently suffering from neglect in Indonesia . Alan Knight, CEO of International Animal Rescue, said: 'As they start to form bonds with each other and then with other orangutans in baby school, they will learn from each other how to behave in the forest and gradually shed their dependence on their human babysitters.' 'We couldn't be happier to see how well Budi is getting on with his new playmate. 'This first meeting is a milestone in the development of both babies.' International Animal Rescue are keen to stress that Budi's story is not an isolate case and there are 'countless' orangutans currently suffering from neglect in Indonesia. The charity is currently caring for 83 orangutans who were being kept illegally as pets. The primates of all ages are now undergoing rehabilitation so they can eventually be released back into the wild. Mr Knight added: 'People are being very generous in their response to Budi's story and I would urge everyone please to keep on supporting us. 'The more people give, the more orangutans we can rescue and help on their journey back to a protected place in the forest where they belong.'

Article: (CNN)So now the real trial is underway: What does the surviving Boston Marathon bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, deserve and why?  What's he likely to get and why? Let's start where the penalty phase starts, with the prosecution's case. Prosecutors have listed, as they must, the aggravating circumstances that make this horrific mass murderer deserve the harshest punishment. The killing was "heinous, cruel and depraved."   He placed a bomb in a crowd, set it to kill and maim children and adults indiscriminately -- if that's not heinous, cruel and depraved, what is? Cruelty classically consists of a desire to cause pain and suffering in innocent victims, or, at the opposite extreme, it reflects a cold, callous indifference. Tsarnaev displayed both. Cruelty really provides us a lens into the worst of the worst of the worst. The number of dead from the bombing (three) and injured (260), including dozens maimed, also elevate these murders.  The victims were vulnerable -- no one more so than 8-year-old Martin Richard.  For 2,500 years, we have proclaimed that all human beings are equally valuable, yet we identify certain victims as especially worthy, and those who prey on them as especially culpable. The prosecution's emphasis: The killings involved "substantial planning and premeditation" and a betrayal of the United States -- the very country that gave Tsarnaev shelter and citizenship. And then there's the selection of the site, the Boston Marathon, an "iconic" event. And then there's Tsarnaev's lack of remorse -- opening day, the prosecutor's final shot of Tsarnaev locked up, giving the security camera the finger.  From his blood-scrawled justification in the boat after the bombing to this day, the message has been: Screw you, society. Tsarnaev may take the stand to beg for mercy, but only if he now feels or at least can fake remorse. And don't confuse regret with remorse.  No doubt Tsarnaev regrets his present predicament, regrets the negative publicity he's brought his friends and family and most poignantly regrets running over and killing his older brother while trying to escape.  But that's a far cry from genuine remorse for the victims he's killed and maimed. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was the lesser of two evils, the defense will insist over and over. Tamerlan was the source of his younger brother's malicious intent.  As the prisoners inside Washington D.C.'s now defunct Lorton Central Prison once described the street code to me:  No snitching, but if someone dies, then "the dead guy did everything." So the defense will claim that Dzhokhar was not fully responsible because he could not be.  After all, he was only 19.  Biologists teach us our brains don't fully develop until we're 25.  Thus, their argument goes, a 19-year-old simply can't be the worst of the worst. In 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the death penalty for those younger than 18 when they killed, repeatedly quoting an article by psychologists Laurence Steinberg and Elizabeth Scott.  But in the same article, these leading developmental psychologists themselves characterized it as an "open question whether under real-world conditions the decision making of mid-adolescents is truly comparable with that of adults." And they were talking about 17-year-olds. To the best of my knowledge, science has not and cannot establish a definitive connection between organic brain development and moral responsibility. Think about it:  When a 19-year-old bravely dashes into a burning building, risking his life to save children inside, we celebrate this heroism. We do not, nor should we, dismiss this bravery as the product of an impulsive not-yet-fully-formed personality.  If we can fully celebrate good character and heroic acts of our best young adults, why can't we fully condemn the cowardly viciousness of our worst? What outcome would I predict in the Tsarnaev case? Confronted by surviving victims and images of their dead loved ones, hearing offsetting pleas to "move on," balancing the real suffering in the courtroom against the  imagined punishment of life that awaits Tsarnaev, I expect the jury will vote 10-2 (or 9-3) for death. But they must be unanimous for death; a lopsided but divided jury would result in a life sentence. Worse, the historical record and headlines in the next day's anti-death penalty news organizations will probably proclaim:  "Jury Chooses Life for the Marathon Bomber" -- even if overwhelmingly the people's representatives were to vote for death as the more appropriate punishment. Requiring a unanimous verdict for death gives the defense an enormous advantage -- one of many.  Why? Because in the end, we would much prefer that 1 or 10 or 20 convicted murderers who deserve to die instead live out their lives in the relatively nonpunitive condition of prison than one person who deserves to live be wrongly killed at the hands of the people. And yet, if we really commit ourselves to having the punishment fit the crime, if we rightly reserve the death penalty for the most heinous crimes and criminals, surely the Boston Marathon bomber stands among the worst of the worst.

Article: March was an impressive month for Arsene Wenger and Arsenal as four Premier League wins from four cemented their place in the Champions League places. And the Frenchman's reward for their good form was another Manager of the Month accolade to sit on his mantelpiece. Wenger has quite a few of the gongs now - 14 to be exact - but he has quite a long way to run until he matches the 27 monthly prizes of Sir Alex Ferguson. Arsene Wenger is March's winner of the Premier League Manager of the Month award - his 14th accolade . Wenger with the Manager of the Month Award for April 2002 - when his Arsenal team won the league title . A grey-suited Wenger with his award from October 2000 - one of 14 he has won at Arsenal . Wenger's Manager of the Month award for March 1998 was delivered in an Easter egg . 75 - England . 52 - Scotland . 17 - France . 12 - Northern Ireland . 9 - Italy . 7 - Ireland, Spain . 5 - Portugal . 4 - Wales . 3 - Chile, Holland . 1 - Argentina, Israel, Sweden . The legendary Manchester United manager was the inaugural winner of the Manager of the Month award when it was introduced in August 1993, at the start of the Premier League's second season. With United winning no fewer than 12 Premier League titles during that time, it comes as little surprise to see the Scot top of the list. In the 1999-2000 campaign, he won it in August, March and April as United romped to the title by 18 points and exerted a similar dominance in 2006-2007, claiming the prize in August, October and February. The last of Ferguson's 27 awards came in October 2012, not long before he announced his retirement. A Manchester United double as Alex Ferguson and Eric Cantona celebrate their awards in 1996 . Ferguson won 27 monthly prizes in all, including this one for February 1997 . Ferguson and Wayne Rooney were celebrating in February 2005 as they claimed the monthly prizes . Wenger first got his hands on the award in March 1998 and also won it the following month as Arsenal claimed the Double of Premier League and FA Cup in his first full campaign. Before this month's win, Wenger had last been recognised in September 2013 as his team made a positive start in a campaign that would ultimately see them finish fourth. He may have struggled to fill Ferguson's shoes at Old Trafford, but David Moyes won this accolade 10 times when in charge of Everton. Harry Redknapp and Martin O'Neill have the monthly award listed eight times on their CVs, while Bobby Robson, Rafa Benitez and Sam Allardyce both have six. Jose Mourinho may have led Chelsea to two Premier League titles but his tally of three is not as many as the four won by Joe Kinnear during his days as Wimbledon manager. 27 - Manchester United . 14 - Arsenal, Liverpool . 13 - Newcastle United . 12 - Everton . 11 - Chelsea . 9 - Manchester City, Southampton . 8 - Tottenham Hotspur . 7 - Aston Villa, Bolton Wanderers . 6 - Blackburn Rovers . 5 - Leeds United, West Ham United . 4 - Leicester City, Wimbledon . 3 - Charlton Athletic, Coventry City, Middlesbrough, Nottingham Forest, Portsmouth, Reading, Sheffield Wednesday, Sunderland, West Bromwich Albion, Wigan Athletic . 2 - Fulham, Swansea City . 1 - Birmingham City, Crystal Palace, Derby County, Hull City, Ipswich Town, Norwich City, Oldham Athletic, Queens Park Rangers . The Manager of the Month  trophy made a nice desk ornament for Everton's David Moyes in September 2004 . Bolton's start to the 2001-02 season earned Sam Allardyce the Manager of the Month prize . Harry Redknapp, then at Southampton, receives the March 2005 award from his son Jamie . Aston Villa boss Martin O'Neill shows off his Manager of the Month award for April 2007 . Jose Mourinho has won the prize on three occasions - including here in March 2007 . But 'The Special One' hasn't cleaned up as much as former Wimbledon boss Joe Kinnear (left), who won four . Remarkably, Kinnear was manager of the month in September 1993, March 1994 and then April 1994 as his team finished sixth before a final award in Septmber 1996. Given Ferguson's dominance, it comes as little surprise that Manchester United come out on top in the clubs list. Wenger's win this month means Arsenal now have 14 overall, the same as Liverpool. Newcastle United aren't far behind with 13, followed by Everton on 12 and Chelsea on 11. English managers dominate the list looking back, with 75 managers from this country having won the prize. The award has been won 52 times by a Scottish manager and 17 times by a Frenchman.

Article: Warrington put a dampener on Kevin Sinfield's 500th appearance for Leeds as they completed a notable double over the Super League leaders in emphatic fashion at Headingley. Sinfield was on the losing side on his debut for the Rhinos against Sheffield Eagles at Headingley in 1997 and he was powerless to prevent a repeat on his landmark occasion, with the Wolves running out 29-10 winners. The Rhinos were already trailing 20-4 when the former England skipper entered the action five minutes into the second half and it did not get much better as the Yorkshiremen came up with their worst performance of the season in front of a 17,430 crowd. Warrington Wolves forward Roy Asotasi crosses for one of his side's five tries on the night . Warrington had produced their best display in an 18-6 win over Leeds in March and they were again outstanding, with full-back Stefan Ratchford and second rower Ben Currie the pick of an impressive bunch. Leeds had an early chance when prop Adam Cuthbertson was held up over the line but then it was virtually all Warrington as they established a stranglehold on the game. Loose forward Ben Harrison was held up on his back before his back-row partner Currie produced a measured grubber kick on the last tackle to create a try for winger Gene Ormsby. Leeds Rhinos winger Kallum Watkins does brilliantly to touch down in the corner . It was then Harrison's turn to demonstrate his kicking skills to get his captain Joel Monaghan in for a second try, although there was a strong hint of a forward pass in the build-up. With scrum-half Richie Myler causing all sorts of problems for the Rhinos defence with his penetrative running, the visitors were good value for their 8-0 lead and it got even better for them on 23 minutes when prop Ashton Sims took hooker Mick Higham's pass near the line to go through a gaping hole for a third try. Ratchford was off target with his first two attempts at goal but it was third time lucky as he made it 14-0 and a Higham 40-20 kick enabled Warrington to maintain the momentum. Warrington forward Ben Harrison is tackled by Stevie Ward during a frantic contest at Headingley . Sinfield stayed on the bench throughout the first half but the introduction of forward Mitch Achurch helped perk up the Rhinos in the last 10 minutes and they pulled a try back in scintillating fashion when winger Kallum Watkins finished off a flowing move at the corner. The Leeds captain entered the action five minutes into the second half but his side were trailing 20-4 by then after a break by lively substitute Daryl Clark created the position for Ratchford to get Currie over for Warrington's fourth try. And there was no way back for Sinfield's men when Ormsby's neat offload enabled substitute prop Roy Asotasi to score his first try for more than 12 months. Leeds Rhinos veteran Kevin Sinfield made his 500th appearance for the club on Friday night . Ratchford kicked his third goal to stretch his side's lead to 26-4 and increased it with a penalty on 63 minutes after Jamie Peacock was pulled up for a high tackle. The home side pulled a try back five minutes later through Achurch and Sinfield kicked the goal but it was little more than consolation and the Wolves had the final say when stand-off Declan Patton slotted a drop goal to open his account for the club on his third appearance.

Article: Three women who were filmed twerking in front a Second World War memorial in Russia have been jailed for hooliganism. In a YouTube video, six dancers are seen performing the provocative and popular move along to music while stood in front of the Malaya Zemlya monument in Novorossiysk, southern Russia. Prosecutors said their 'erotic and sexual twerk dance' was disrespectful to those who fought in the war and jailed two of the women for ten days and a third for 15 days. Scroll down for video . 'Hooliganism': Three women have been jailed after releasing a video of their dance group twerking in front of the Malaya Zemlya monument in Novorossiysk, southern Russia . Two others escaped with fines, while another dancer avoided punishment altogether as she was under 16 - with a reprimand being handed down to her mother instead. According to the BBC, prosecutors said: 'This incident of disrespect for the memory of war history is unacceptable and any attempts to desecrate sites of military glory will be stopped immediately.' The Youtube video currently has more than 400,000 views and sees the six dancers performing a well-choreographed one and a half minute routine. After surfacing earlier this week,it was brought to the attention of the mayor of Novorossiysk, where the women are from. The mayor was said to be 'outraged' and personally charged officials with identifying the names of the performers - who posted the video to attract new recruits to their modern dance school . 'We condemn these women. Every inch of this land is covered in blood. It is inappropriate,' said Viktoriya Dikaya, the press secretary for the city's education department. Recruitment video: The one minute 30 second clip was posted by the women to encourage people to join their dance school . Punished: Two of the girls were jailed for ten days, while a third was sentenced to 15 days in prison. Two others were fined, while the sixth dancer escaped punishment as she was under 16 . Prosecutors are now said to be  carrying out checks at the institutions where the women, who were all under 30, are enrolled, to make sure they are in compliance with 'programs aimed at ensuring respect for the law among their members', reports RT.com. The Malaya Zemlya memorial, completed in 1982, commemorates a battle to free Novorossiysk from German occupation in 1943. The women's sentences come as Russia prepares to mark the 70th anniversary of the Second World War victory. The incident comes just weeks after Russian officials closed down a dance school after footage emerged of teenage students performing hip-thrusting moves on stage. The video clip, entitled Winnie the Pooh and the Bees, showed a group of teenage girls dancing in striped leotards, long socks and mini-skirts at the Orenburg dance school in southwest of the country. Condemned: Prosecutors said the women's 'erotic and sexual twerk dance' was disrespectful to those who fought in the Second World War . Increased sensitivity: The women's sentences come as Russia prepares to mark the 70th anniversary of the Second World War victory . A committee is currently investigating whether the hip-thrusting performance amounts to negligence or even 'debauched action' - punishable by a range of sanctions from community service to three years behind bars. In 2012, members of the Russian punk band Pussy Riot were jailed after performing a protest song in Moscow's main cathedral - also on charges of hooliganism. Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina were not released until the end of 2013 after their act was seen as 'hooliganism motivated by religious hatred'. Historical site: The dancers performed at the Malaya Zemlya memorial, completed in 1982 to commemorate a battle to free Novorossiysk from German occupation in 1943 . Recent controversy: Just weeks ago, Russian officials closed down a dance school in Orenburg after students posted this twerking video to YouTube .

Article: A family of four are lucky to be alive after a bedroom ceiling collapsed in their home. The damage was just part of the destruction caused by cowboy builders who had been called in to fix a leak in the Beckle-Raymond's three bedroom property in North London. Instead, they left Phillip, his wife Gaby and their two young children, Orion and Aurielle, in an unsafe building with no roof while they ran off with £17,000 of their money. Scroll down for video . Phillip and Gaby outside their London home which was left a wreck thanks to cowboy builders . 'When the builders walked out, we only had tarpaulin protecting the house throughout winter,' Gaby explains on Channel 5 show Britain's Horror Homes. 'When it rained, water started coming in, it was raining inside our house. The box room caved in, the bathroom became bowed, the ceiling will fall in the children's room. 'The most terrifying experience was the ceiling falling in the bedroom where we used to sleep. It collapsed where our bed used to be. We weren't in room at time thankfully.' For six months, the family were forced to live in one room of the house as they couldn't afford to get the problems fixed straight away, having already shelled out to the cowboy builders who left them in the lurch. Phillip, a civil servant, said: 'The house was crumbling around us, we had to turn off the lights as water was getting into electricity, it was that time of year when it was getting dark at 4pm, it was miserable. I hated leaving Gaby and the children like that when I had to go to work.' Phillip and Gaby had used all their savings to buy the property five years before for £325,000. The builders left the family with no roof and just tarpaulin protecting the house from the winter elements. As a result, rain got into the property causing ceilings to collapse . The parents say they are devastated at being 'taken for a ride'. It will cost £35,000 to repair their home . As they started a family, they worked hard to turn the house into a happy and comfortable place to raise their children. When they sprung a small leak in part of the roof, they called in a builder who recommended they re-tile the roof at a cost of about £3,000. But after removing all the tiles, he then told them that the roof structure was unsound so he wouldn't be able to re-tile. He suggested they use the opportunity to expand their home and add value to the property by adding a loft conversion. The couple thought it was great idea and decided to use a sub contractor their builder recommended and pay a £7,000 deposit for the work. Gaby said: 'The first builder appeared to be trustyworthy and was very professional, very likable. 'We didn't have time to check out the sub contractor he recommended as we were without a roof which we needed to be fixed.' A back view of the property shows how the garden was left looking like a rubbish tip while the house had no roof. The family had to live in one room for six months as they couldn't afford the repairs . So far the couple had paid the first builder £10,000 in total - and had a home with no roof to show for it. After the sub contractor began to work on their home, the first builder then disappeared. Phillip said: 'We heard from sub contractor that the builder's uncle was sick in Ireland so he was going there - we never hard from him again.' Meanwhile, the sub contractor began work on their loft conversion after asking for £7,000 for materials and labour. But as the sub contractor got to work, the couple became suspicious about his competency. Gaby said: 'He was trying to build a loft conversion without steel supports - which we had paid for. 'That's when we realised he was trying to take us for a ride like the first guy.' Phillip added: 'When we told him it wasn't acceptable, he walked off the job. We were left with a roof no longer salvageable.' Shocking: The collapse of the roof left their home filled with rubble . Daylight: With the tiles gone, the family were left with bare rafters and no protection from the elements . The couple were unable to contact the first builder and have reported the sub contractor to Trading Standards. They have been left devastated by the state of their home - as well as £17,000 out of pocket. 'We have lost the home we have been building over the last few years, our whole house has been destroyed, it's been a living nightmare. We wish they have never knocked on our door,' Gabby wept. 'I just want it fixed. I still can't believe someone would leave me my husband and our two children in so much danger. They didn't need to leave us in such an unsafe way.' But the family's trust in humanity has been partly restored thanks to the friends, family and strangers who rallied round to help them. A friend set up a fundraising page so people can donate money to help the couple reach the £35,000 they will need to repair their home. Unsafe: The family are devastated that they have been left to live in an unsafe home . Damage: A local builder Darren Louis has been helping the family to clear up the mess left behind . A local builder, Darren Louis, has been working on the property at weekends - so far without payment - so the family have a roof over their heads again. He said: I wanted to help as this is my trade and they are a lovely family. They didn't need to do the work in the first place, they were scaremongered into it and then left with a house that's unsafe.' Gaby said: 'I feel terrible he's coming here and we haven't paid him. He's coming in trust that we will come through with money in the end.' Phillip said it's thanks to their friends, family and neighbours they have got through their ordeal. He said: 'We were left thinking "can we trust anyone anymore?" and now we know we can.'

Article: (CNN)Lane Bryant has come up with a devil of an idea to market its lingerie while poking fun at a competitor. The plus-size clothing retailer has launched an ad campaign for its Cacique line titled #ImNoAngel, seeking to "redefine sexy." In a commercial posted on You Tube, a group of plus-size models show off the bras and panties while saying things like "How boring would it be if we were all the same?" and "It's all about how you feel." The campaign is a not-so-subtle dig at Victoria's Secret and its very popular Angels line, which caters to smaller women. The lingerie giant was criticized last year for a campaign featuring the words "Perfect Body" over images of slender supermodels, and Business Insider reports that it is under increasing pressure from consumers to offer larger sizes. Lane Bryant's campaign is getting positive buzz in social media land, with the company being hailed for celebrating beauty of all shapes and sizes. "Our '#ImNoAngel' campaign is designed to empower ALL women to love every part of herself," Chief Executive Officer Linda Heasley said in a statement. "Lane Bryant firmly believes that she is sexy and we want to encourage her to confidently show it, in her own way." The ads will be featured in the company's stores, on television, in print and on billboards, as well as featured on the brand's social media accounts.

Article: The timing is surely a coincidence – three days before her daughter is due to give birth to another royal baby, Carole Middleton is busy promoting her party firm’s baby-shower goodies. The mother of the Duchess of Cambridge emailed customers of her Party Pieces firm yesterday, recommending the Chevron Divine tablewear range for parents-to-be. Mrs Middleton, 60, who has previously been accused of cashing in after her daughter Kate married Prince William, wrote: ‘I love a range that fits so many different gatherings. Chevron Divine is just that, and it’s great for a baby shower.’ Scroll down for video . The mother of the Duchess of Cambridge emailed customers of her Party Pieces firm yesterday, re commending the Chevron Divine tablewear range for parents-to-be . And, in keeping with news that William and Kate do not know the sex of their baby – the fourth in line to the throne, she adds: ‘It teams blue and pink together – perfect if you don’t know what sex the baby is . And, in keeping with news that William and Kate do not know the sex of their baby – the fourth in line to the throne, she adds: ‘It teams blue and pink together – perfect if you don’t know what sex the baby is.’ The cheapest item in the range is a £2.79 set of party cups. It also includes straws for £3.49 and cake bunting at £7.69. Mrs Middleton started Party Pieces at home more than 25 years ago and its success has made her a multi-millionaire. But it was criticised for bringing out tacky merchandise for the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee, such as Corgi-themed scratchcards. However, friends point out that the firm was set up years before the future king began dating Kate, and as head of one of Britain’s leading party goods suppliers Mrs Middleton would not be doing her job if she failed to mark major royal events.
